<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>TADS Workbench is an integrated environment for writing
TADS games.  TADS Workbench lets you run the compiler, resource
bundler, executable builder, and debugger, all with simple menu
commands, eliminating the need to enter complex command lines to run
the compiler and other tools.  TADS Workbench also lets you view and
edit your source files with a full-featured built-in text editor.

<h2>
Starting a New Game
</h2>

<p> TADS Workbench includes a "Wizard" that creates a starter game
for you automatically.  All you have to do is answer a few
questions to tell TADS where to put your game files.  See
<a href='newgame.htm'>Creating a New Game</a> for step-by-step
instructions.

<h2>
<a name='loadgame'>Loading an Existing Game</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you've already created your game's source files, you can load the
game into TADS Workbench from either the source file or the compiled
game file:

<ul>
<li>Open TADS Workbench.
<li>At the "Welcome" dialog, select "Open an Existing Game."  (If you've
disabled the Welcome dialog, open the "File" menu, then select "Load Game.")
<li>Select either your game's source file (which usually ends in ".t")
or your game's compiled game file (which usually ends in ".t3").  You
can also select your game's "project" file, whose name is the same as
the game file's, but ends in ".t3c" (for "TADS 3 Configuration").
You don't directly created .t3c files; Workbench creates one of these for
you automatically the first time you load a particular game.
  <ul>
  <li>If you select a .t3 or .t3c file, TADS Workbench will load the game and
  you'll be ready to start working.
  <li>If you select a source file, TADS Workbench will ask you to identify
  the compiled game file.  The project file for your game always
  goes with your compiled game file, not your source file, so TADS Workbench
  can't identify your game's project file based on the source file alone.
  </ul>
<li>If your game doesn't already have a project file, TADS Workbench
will create one.
</ul>

<h2>
Editing Source Code
</h2>

<p> Workbench has a built-in text editor that you can use to edit your
source code.  The integrated editor is a popular programmer's text
editor called Scintilla, which has all the features you'd expect from
a programmer's editor: multi-level undo, syntax coloring, automatic
indenting, and much more.

<p>Remember that when you make changes to your source code, you must
always <b>save</b> and <b>compile</b> before the changes will take
effect.  If you run without recompiling, you'll still be running the
old version of your game.

<p>If you prefer to use a separate text editor application to edit
your source code, you can use the "External Editor" page of the
Options dialog to tell Workbench how to open your editor program.
Refer to <a href="helped.htm">Using an External Editor</a> for
details.


<h2>
Searching the Documentation
</h2>

<p>The Search toolbar lets you search for keywords in the TADS
documentation.  This works a lot like a Web search - you just type
the keywords you want to find and press Return.  Workbench will
open a window showing the documentation pages that match your
search, showing the "best" (most relevant) matches first.

<p>Note that the Search toolbar has a little button next to the
search box that lets you change the type of search it performs.
Use the drop-down menu to change the search type.  Make sure
that "Search User's Manuals" is selected when you want to perform
a documentation search.

<p>The doc search system has some special syntax that you can use to
customize the search.  By default, the search system looks for pages
that contain <b>every</b> word you enter, allowing for common
variations in the words - for example, if you type <tt>operator</tt>, the
search will also match variations like operators, operating, operated,
and so on.

<p>If you want to look for pages that contain <b>any</b> of several
words, you can separate the words with the keyword OR.  (The keyword
must be entered in <b>all upper case letters</b>.)  For example, if
you type <tt>operator OR expression</tt>, the search will find pages
that contain <i>either</i> of those words (again, including common
variations on the words).

<p>You can also <b>exclude</b> words from the search, by preceding
each word you want to exclude with the keyword NOT (which must be in
<b>all upper case letters</b>).  For example, if you type <tt>operator
NOT expression</tt>, the search will find pages that contain
"operator" (and common variations), and will exclude any pages that
also contain "expression" (or variations).

<p>If you want to search for an <b>exact word</b>, without allowing
the search system to look for common variations of the word, enclose
the word in double quotes.  For example, <tt>"operator"</tt> will
find only that word, not variations like operators, operated, etc.

<p>You can also use quotes to look for an <b>exact phrase</b>, in
cases where you want to find two or more words in a particular order.
For example, <tt>"addition operator"</tt> would find only pages
containing that exact phrase.

<h2>
Searching in Files
</h2>

<p>Workbench provides several ways to search for text in the files
in your project.

<p>The Search bar lets you perform a quick search of the current text
editor window or of the entire project's text files.  Use the
drop-down menu next to the search box to select which type of search
you'd like to perform, then type the text you'd like to find and press
Return.  If you perform a Current File search, Workbench will simply
highlight the next instance of the text in the file.  If you perform a
Project search, Workbench will open a window showing a list of the
matching lines throughout the project - click on a match to jump to
that file location.

<p>Unlike the Documentation search system, File and Project searches
do <b>not</b> use the "keyword" search system.  So, these searches
don't look for variations on the words you type, and they don't allow
the OR or NOT keywords or the quoting syntax.  Instead, File and
Project searches simply look for the <b>literal text</b> you enter.
The search is case-insensitive (meaning that it ignores upper-case and
lower-case differences in the text), but otherwise looks for exactly
the text you enter.

<p>If you want more File search options, use the Find command on the
Edit menu.  This lets you perform regular-expression searches (these
are like "wildcard" searches, but more powerful - you can use the full
TADS 3 regular expression syntax, which you can read about in the TADS
3 manuals if you search for "regular expressions"), case-sensitive
matching, and whole-word matching.

<p>If you want more Project-wide search options, use the Find in Project
Files command on the Project menu.  This lets you specify regular
expression, exact-case, and whole-word searches throughout the
project.

<p><b>Collapsing spaces:</b> When you perform a project-wide search
(the Find in Project Files command), the search dialog has a checkbox
labeled "Collapse spaces and newlines."  If you select this checkbox,
the searcher will "collapse" each run of whitespace it finds in each
file before searching the file.  That is, the searcher looks for any
series of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines), and
converts each consecutive series of these characters into a single
space.  It then searches the result for your search string or regular
expression pattern.

<p>A big benefit of this feature is that it allows the searcher to
match your string or pattern even when the matching text in the file
is split across two or more lines.  This is especially useful when
you're searching for a term that occurs in paragraphs of text, such as
in long description strings - long strings in source code are often
broken up over several lines for readability.

<p>Note one bit of caution you have to use with this feature: you have
to be careful to avoid putting multiple consecutive spaces in your
<i>search</i> string.  If you do, the term will never match anything
when the "collapse spaces" option is in effect, because all runs of
multiple spaces will be stripped out of the source text before it's
searched.


<h2>
Compiling
</h2>

<p>
TADS Workbench offers a graphical interface to the TADS compiler,
resource bundler, and executable builder.  To compile your game,
first configure your compilation options by opening the "Build" menu
and selecting "Settings," then compile by opening the "Build" menu
and selecting the appropriate "Compile" command.  See
<a href='helpcomp.htm'>Compiling with TADS Workbench</a> for details.

<h2>
Debugging
</h2>

<p>
The core of TADS Workbench is the TADS Debugger.  After you've
compiled your game, you can run it within TADS Workbench by
using the "Go" command (on the toolbar or in the "Debug" menu).
The <a href='helptdb.htm'>Debugger Overview</a> describes the
debugger in greater detail.

<h2>
<a name='config'>Project Files (.t3c)</a>
</h2>

<p> TADS Workbench stores information on your game in a special file
called a "project file."  A project file contains
information of interest only to TADS Workbench; you don't need to
edit this file directly.

<p>Each game has its own separate project file, because the
information in the file is specific to the game.
The project file for a game always has the same name as the
compiled game file, with the ".t3" suffix replaced by the ".t3c" suffix,
and is always in the same directory as the compiled game file.

<p>The project file contains information on the window layout,
debugger breakpoints, option settings, and build parameters.

<p>
TADS Workbench will always create a new project file for you
when you open a game that doesn't already have a project file.
You don't need to do anything special to create or manage project
files; TADS Workbench handles them automatically without requiring
any action on your part.

<p>
Note that, when loading a game, you can load the .t3c file or the .t3
file; the two are interchangeable for the purposes of loading a game
into TADS Workbench.
