<h1>TADS Workbench Docking Windows</h1>
</center>

<br><br><br>
<p> The debugger's stack, local variables, watch, and call history
windows are "docking" windows.  This means that you can attach these
windows to an edge of the main debugger window; once docked, a window
will stay attached to its edge as you move and resize the main
debugger window.  In addition, a docked window will always stay in
front of a source window.

<p>
A dockable window has three possible states:

<ul>
<li>Docked.  In the docked state, the window is attached to an edge of
the main debugger window.  A docked window has a special kind of control
bar; you can use this like an ordinary title bar to drag the window to
a new location.  Here's an example of a window docked at the bottom of
the debugger main window:
<p>
<center><img src='dock1.jpg'>
</center>

<li>Undocked.  In this state, the window looks like an ordinary window,
except that it has a slightly smaller caption bar.  An undocked window
floats above all of the other windows.

<li>Normal non-docking view.  In this state, a window behaves the
same way as a regular source file window, and source windows can
overlap in front of the window.

</ul>

<p>
You can switch between a dockable window's states in a number of ways.
Right-click on the title bar (or the control bar, if the window is
docked), and the window will pop up a menu that lets you select the
state:

<p><center><img src='dock2.jpg'></center>

<p>
If the window is undocked, select the "Dock" item on the pop-up
menu to return the window to its most recent docking position.  If
the window is docked, select the "Undock" item on the menu (or simply
double-click on the control bar) to undock the window.  Check or un-check
the "Docking View" item to switch between a dockable window and a normal
window.

<p>
If the window is docked, you can move the window to a new docking position
or undock the window by dragging its control bar to a new location.  Move
the mouse near the edge of the debugger frame window to dock at a new
position along the frame.  If you hold down the "Ctrl" key (marked "Control"
on some keyboards), the window will not dock even if you move it near the
edge of the frame window; this can be useful if you want to leave the window
undocked near the edge of the frame.

<h3>Hints on Changing Docking Positions</h3>

<p>
If you want to change the docking position of a docked or undocked window,
click on the window's title bar (or the special control bar, if it's already
docked somewhere) and drag the window, the same way you would move any
ordinary window.  Move the mouse cursor near the center of the edge of
the main frame window where you want to dock the window; when you get
close enough, the gray drag outline will jump into the docking position.
Remember, the docking position is based on the <i>mouse cursor</i>
position -- you must move the mouse cursor within a few pixels of the
edge of the frame window, near the center of the edge where you want
to dock the window.

<p>
If you're trying to dock a window on the left or right edge of the
frame, and it stubbornly wants to dock at the top or bottom edge, you
should try moving the mouse cursor more toward the center of the vertical
edge you're trying to dock against.  The docking mechanism gives priority
to docking at the top or bottom, so sometimes you have to move a little
further away from the top or bottom edge in order to dock on the left
or right edge.

<p>
If your Windows color settings display the main debugger frame window's
background area in gray, it can sometimes be hard to see the gray drag
outline as you're moving a docking window.  You can usually see the
drag outline if you look really carefully; if you'd prefer not to strain
your eyes, an easy trick is to maximize one of your source windows, so that
the whole background area is covered up by the background color of a source
window (which is usually white), then try dragging your docking window.

<h3>Sharing a Docking Edge</h3>

<p>
You can share a single edge of the frame window with two or
more docking windows.  There are two ways of doing this.

<p><b>Splitting the edge:</b> You can put two or more docking
windows side-by-side along a docking edge.  To do this, dock the
first window, then drag the second window over the first docked
window.  This will split the edge in half, giving each window half
of the available space.  You can then use the splitter bar between
the two windows to reapportion the space, if you'd like.  You can
drop additional windows to further subdivide the space.

<p><b>Stacking:</b> You can stack docking windows, so that each window
has the entire width or height of the edge.  To do this, dock the first
window along the edge.  Then, drag the second window so that it's along
the same edge, just inside the frame from the first window.  For example,
dock a window on the bottom edge, then drag another window so it's just
<i>above</i> the first window; the second window will dock along the
bottom edge as well, above (inside the frame from) the first docked window.
