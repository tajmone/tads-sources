<p>
If you're reading this file, it probably means that you've selected
"TADS 3 Manual" from the TADS Workbench Help menu, but the documentation
files aren't installed on your system.  The documentation files should
have been installed along with TADS Workbench, but these files have
evidently been deleted or moved.  Please re-install TADS.
