<title>HTML TADS Latin-2 Character Entities</title>

<h1>HTML TADS Latin-2 Character Entities</h1>

HTML TADS provides named character entities for the ISO Latin-2
(ISO 8859-2) character set.  These entities are TADS extensions to the
standard HTML specification; these entities are not currently part of
standard HTML, and will not work with all ordinary HTML browsers.
(However, the entity names are all from the SGML Latin-2 character set,
so these names should be compatible with any future HTML versions that
support the Latin-2 named entities.)

<p>
Latin-2 is a character set designed for Eastern and Central European
languages.  This charater set has many of the same characters as ISO Latin-1,
which is the standard HTML character set, but includes additional
accented characters for Eastern and Central European languages
(Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovenian, Serbian)
that are not part of the ISO Latin-1 character set.

<p>
Here are the named character entities in Latin-2 that are not also
in Latin-1; in addition to the names, the numeric equivalents are listed.
Note that you can enter the numeric values with the &amp;#nnn; notation,
although we strongly recommend using the named entities for greater
clarity in your source text.

<h3>Availability of Latin-2 Characters</h3>

<p>
Latin-2 characters are not available on all systems.  Computers that
are localized for use in North America or Western Europe frequently
provide only a Western European charater set; most Western European
character sets do not provide equivalents for the ISO Latin-2
characters.  Computers localized for use with an Eastern or Central
European language will usually provide fonts that include
all of the Latin-2 characters.

<p>On computers where
no Latin-2 fonts are installed, HTML TADS will display the default
"missing character" glyph (which is usually an empty rectangle on
graphical systems) for these characters.

<h4>Windows NT</h4>
Because Windows NT
is a Unicode-based system, most NT installations (regardless of
localization) will include at least a few standard fonts that incorporate
these characters.

<h4>Windows 95</h4>

<p>
Windows 95 systems that are not localized for an Eastern or Central
European country are less likely than NT systems to have a font with these
characters.  However, Microsoft makes available extensions for the standard
Windows 95 fonts for most of the Eastern and Central European
character sets.  To install these extensions, download
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/LANG.EXE">http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/LANG.EXE</a>
from the Microsoft web site, then run the downloaded program.
