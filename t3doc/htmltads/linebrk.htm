<title>Word Wrapping and Line Breaking in HTML TADS</title>

<h1>Word Wrapping and Line Breaking in HTML TADS</h1>

<p>The HTML 3.2 standard doesn't specify how user agents (the
standard's term for a browser) should break up long lines of text to
make them fit into the available display width.  In practice, nearly
all browsers use "word wrapping" to break up text lines; this means
that the browser inserts line breaks at word boundaries only, so that
an individual word is never split across two lines of text.
This is the way HTML TADS works by default, too, but HTML TADS provides
some additional features that let the game override the default
rules and take control of how text is wrapped.  This section describes
these advanced line breaking controls.

<h2>The Two Basic Wrapping Modes</h2>

<p>To start with, HTML TADS has two basic modes for text wrapping:
word and character.

<p>In word-wrapping mode, the formatter will only break a line
between words.  This is the default mode, and is the style that almost
always applies to languages like English that use groups of letters to
represent words.  The formatter's rules for determining word
boundaries are simple: a word boundary is a space, or a hyphen (but a
break can occur only to the right of a hyphen, and only when the
hyphen isn't followed by another hyphen).

<p>In character-wrapping mode, the formatter can break a line
anywhere.  This mode is especially applicable to languages like
Chinese in which each character represents an entire word.  In
Chinese, convention allows line breaks to occur almost anywhere; each
glyph is a separate word, so there is no need to keep most pairs of
adjacent glyphs together on one line.

<h3>Selecting the Wrapping Mode: the &lt;WRAP&gt; Tag</h3>

<p>The game sets the wrapping mode using the &lt;WRAP&gt; tag (which
is a TADS extension, not a standard HTML tag).  &lt;WRAP WORD&gt; sets
word-wrapping mode, and &lt;WRAP CHAR&gt; sets character-wrapping
mode.  The interpreter always starts in word-wrapping mode.  This tag
is not a container, but simply an in-line mode switch, so there is no
&lt;/WRAP&gt; tag; to change out of the current mode, simply use another
&lt;WRAP&gt; tag with the new mode.

<h2>Overriding the Default Breaking Rules</h2>

<p>The default line-breaking rules -- in both word-wrap and
character-wrap modes -- are very simple, and aren't adequate for every
situation.  For example, a game written in English might have some
words that include hyphens that should always be kept together on one
line, or a word that includes some other embedded punctuation that
could serve as line-break points if needed.  As another example, a
game written in Chinese wouldn't really want line breaks to occur just
anywhere; the conventions for line-breaking in Chinese actually
require that certain sequences of characters, such as certain groups
of punctuation marks, be kept together, and don't allow line breaks to
occur just before or after certain types of punctuation.

<p>It would be impossible to anticipate every possible line-breaking
rule for every language and every game, so HTML TADS doesn't even try;
instead, the interpreter uses the rather simple set of rules outlined
above by default, but provides a set of special control sequences that
allow the game to override the default behavior whenever it wants.
These special controls are described below.

<h3>The Zero-Width Non-Breaking Space</h3>

<p>The first special control prevents a line break, and is called the
"zero-width non-breaking space."  This is a special markup, written as
"&amp;zwnbsp;".  It's a "zero-width" character, which means that it
doesn't show up on the display: it's simply invisible as far as the
user is concerned.  The "non-breaking" part is the special feature:
this tells the interpreter that it cannot break the line here, even if
it otherwise could.

<p>To be more specific, the zero-width non-breaking space prevents a
line break from occurring between the two characters adjacent to it.
Essentially, this control is a bit of glue that sticks so strongly to
the characters on both sides that the line breaking rules can't tear
them apart.

<p>Note that the glue only sticks to one side of each adjacent
character.  So, if you put a &amp;zwnbsp character just before a
space, and you're in word-wrapping mode, the formatter can still break
the line after the space.  If you want to prevent the space from being
a line break at all, you have to put a &amp;zwnbsp character on both
sides of the space-one before and one after.

<h3>The Zero-Width Space</h3>

<p>The second special control is the "zero-width space," and it does
essentially the opposite of the zero-width non-breaking space: this
character enables a line break where the rules would otherwise not
allow it.  This markup is written "&amp;zwsp;".  Like &amp;zwnbsp,
this is a zero-width character, so it's invisible on the display.
Otherwise, though, it counts as a space -- which means that the
formatter, even in word-wrap mode, is free to break the line between
the two adjacent characters, as though they were separated by an
ordinary space.

<p>You can use a zero-width space to add your own rules about where
lines can be broken.  For example, suppose your game has a bunch of
words where you're using an equals sign as though it were a hyphen,
and you want the formatter to be able to break to the right of these
equals signs just like it would for hyphens.  To do this, you would
simply insert a &amp;zwsp character immediately after each of these
equals signs; this would tell the interpreter that it can break the
line just after the hyphen if necessary.

<h3>The Non-Breaking Space</h3>

<p>Standard HTML defines its own non-breaking space character, written
as "&amp;nbsp;".  This character is displayed exactly like an ordinary
space (the kind you get by pressing the space bar on the keyboard),
but it behaves as though it were a non-space character: the formatter
never breaks a line at a non-breaking space (thus the name), it never
combines a non-breaking space with adjacent ordinary spaces, and it
never trims a non-breaking space from the beginning or end of a line.
For line-breaking purposes, the non-breaking space behaves as though
it were an alphabetic character.

<p>Apart from the obvious difference in visual size, the non-breaking
space differs from the zero-width non-breaking space in that the
zero-width version is like glue -- it prevents a line break from being
inserted between the adjacent characters.  The ordinary non-breaking
space, however, merely acts like any other non-space character; if the
line-breaking rules allow it, the formatter can break the line
immediately before or after an ordinary non-breaking space.

<h3>The Soft Hyphen</h3>

<p>Standard HTML defines another special control, the "soft hyphen,"
written as "&amp;shy;".  This character tells the interpreter that it
can break a word with hyphenation at a particular point, but that it
doesn't have to.

<p>Soft hyphens are normally invisible, so you can freely insert them
into words without adding visual clutter.  When the formatter decides
to take advantage of a soft hyphen to break a line, though, the soft
hyphen is displayed as a normal hyphen at the end of the line.
