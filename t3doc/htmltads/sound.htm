<title>HTML TADS Sounds and Music</title>

<h1>HTML TADS Sounds and Music</h1>

HTML TADS provides an extension to HTML that allows a game author
to use sound effects and music within a game.  Standard HTML doesn't
have any support for sound, and the popular browsers mostly delegate
sound support to third-party "plug-in" products, so there are no
good examples of HTML sound extensions that TADS could have used
as a basis.  Because of this, the sound features
in HTML TADS aren't based on any existing HTML implementations.

<h3>Sound and Music Formats</h3>

HTML TADS supports several sound formats as of version 2.5.6: MIDI for
music (in the standard MIDI file format), Windows WAV (waveform
digitized audio) for digitized sound effects; MP3 for compressed,
digitized sound and music; and Ogg Vorbis digital audio.  MP3 support
was added in version 2.2.7; previous versions only supported the MIDI
and WAV formats.  Ogg Vorbis support was added in version 2.5.6.  (The
technical name for MP3 is MPEG 2.0 Audio Layer III.  HTML TADS
supports this as well as Audio Layer II.)

<p> While these formats aren't universal standards, they <i>are</i>
widely supported and well-documented.  Many multimedia authoring tools
will produce files in these formats, and a large number of public
domain files are available for all of the formats.  In addition,
together, these formats address most of the needs that game authors
are likely to have when designing games.  WAV provides high-quality
digitized recordings that can reproduce essentially any sound, while
MIDI provides a versatile and compact format for storing music.  MP3
and Ogg Vorbis are compressed digital audio formats that offer high
fidelity but much smaller file sizes than uncompressed WAV; both work
well for sound effects and music.


<h3>Why you should use Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3</h3>

<p>We recommend using Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3 for digitized audio
in your TADS creations.

<p>Ogg Vorbis and MP3 are equivalent in terms of form and function.
They both take digitized audio files and compress them to a fraction
of their original size.  Both are "lossy": they achieve high
compression ratios by discarding details in the original signal that
they deem inaudible or minimally audible.  Both formats have encoders
that let you select just how lossy the compression is, as a trade-off
against file size.  In terms of TADS playback capabilities, Ogg and
MP3 are completely interchangeable.

<p>If they're so equivalent, why use Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3, when
MP3 is so ubiquitous?

<p>The big reason to use Ogg Vorbis is that it's a fully free and open
source format.  MP3 is not; certain commercial entities claim patent
rights to various aspects of MP3.  The patent entanglements make MP3 a
pariah on Linux systems, to such a degree that <b>some Linux TADS
distros intentionally disable MP3 support</b>.  If you use MP3 in
your game, players on those Linux systems will encounter dead air on
playback.  Ogg Vorbis is supported on every Multimedia TADS platform,
and it's built in to all of them - users don't have to fuss with
codecs or other add-ons.

<p>What's more, Ogg is considered to be the better format technically.
It achieves higher compression ratios with better audio quality.  Your
music and sound effects will most likely sound better if you use Ogg.

<p>Really, the only point in MP3's favor is inertia - you're probably
more familiar with it than Ogg, and you probably have an MP3 encoder
that you already know how to use.  Inertia's hard to overcome, but the
encoder problem is easily solved, at least.  Search for
<b>oggDropXPd</b> for a free Ogg encoder for Windows that you can
download and install in less than a minute.  Just drop your WAV files
on it, and they'll turn into Ogg files.



<h3>MIDI</h3>

<p>HTML TADS has support for MIDI, but we don't strongly recommend
using it for new work.  MIDI support on PCs has always been a little
unpredictable, because operating systems tend to farm out MIDI
playback to the sound card hardware.  That makes the quality of MIDI
playback highly variable.  It also creates limitations in what TADS
can do with MIDI playback.  For example, TADS can't always perform
fades on MIDI tracks, and on many machines it's limited to a single
MIDI track at a time, so you can't always cross-fade or overlap MIDI
tracks.

<p>MIDI resources in an HTML TADS game must be named with a ".mid" or
".midi" suffix.


<a name='mpeg'></a>
<h3>MP3 Audio</h3>

<p>MP3 is a compressed digital audio format that's suitable for any
type of audio, from music to voice recordings to sound effects.

<p>As we mentioned above, we recommend using Ogg Vorbis over MP3,
due to the wider availability of Ogg and its superior audio quality
and compression power.

<p>MP3 is more formally known as MPEG 2.0 Audio layer III.  TADS
supports MPEG 2.0 audio layers II and III.

<p>MP3 resources in an HTML TADS game must be named with one of
the following suffixes:

<p>
<pre>
    .MPG
    .MP2
    .MP3
</pre>

<p>The different suffixes are usually used to indicate which
sub-format of MPEG the file uses, but for TADS resources, you can use
them interchangeably.  TADS detects the MPEG sub-format automatically
by inspecting the file contents.

<p>Digitized audio is suitable for both music and sound effects, so
HTML TADS allows MP3 audio to be used in any layer.  TADS doesn't
assume anything about which layer is appropriate for a particular MP3,
so a &lt;SOUND&gt; tag with an MP3 source must specify a layer.

<a name='ogg'></a>
<h3>The Ogg Vorbis Audio Format</h3>

<p>Ogg Vorbis is another compressed digital audio format, suitable for
digitized sound effects and music.  Like MP3, it's a perceptually
coded, "lossy" audio compression format.  Unlike MP3, it was created
as a fully free and open-source format.  Ogg is widely
considered to have better compression ratios and audio quality than
MP3.

<p>Freeware tools for encoding and playing Ogg Vorbis files are
available on the Web.  You can find information and links to Ogg
Vorbis software and sample music files at <a
href='http://www.vorbis.com'>Vorbis.com</a>.  Reference information
about the Ogg Vorbis format is available at
<a href='http://www.xiph.org'>Xiph.org</a>.

<p>
In HTML TADS, Ogg Vorbis resources must be named with the suffix
".OGG".

<p> Ogg Vorbis audio is suitable for both music and sound effects, so
the HTML TADS sound system allows this format to be used in any layer.
HTML TADS doesn't make assumptions about which layer is appropriate for a
particular Ogg Vorbis sound, so all &lt;SOUND&gt; tags
with Ogg sources must specify a layer.

<h3>Sound Architecture</h3>

<h4>Layers</h4>

<p>Sounds in HTML TADS are divided into four "layers": the background
layer, the background ambient layer, the ambient layer, and the
foreground layer.  <i>(Note: these layers don't have anything to do
with MPEG layers, which are simply different encoding formats - see <a
href="#mpeg">above</a>.)</i>

<p>Each layer is essentially an independent audio output.  You can
think of the system as an audio mixing studio where you have four CD
players hooked up to one set of speakers, with all the outputs mixed
together.  You can pop a different CD into each player, and start and
stop them independently.  Each layer corresponds to a CD player, so
you can play a different sound file in each layer, and you can control
starts, stops, and track changes in each layer individually.

<p>
The <b>background</b> layer is used for music.  Background music can
repeat to provide a continuous soundtrack, and you can program
multiple selections that play one after another.  You can change
the background music whenever you want; for example, each room can
have its own background music.

<p>
The <b>bgambient</b> (background ambient) layer is used for continuous
digitized sound effects.  The purpose of this layer is essentially the
same as that of the background layer, but the bgambient layer is used
for digitized sound effects instead of music.

<p>
The <b>ambient</b> layer is used for sound effects that occur in the
background, but not continuously like the background music.
You can set up a group of ambient sounds that will play randomly
to enhance the atmosphere.  As with background music, you can
change the ambient sounds whenever you want; you can, for example,
provide an appropriate set of ambient sound effects for each location.

<p>
The <b>foreground</b> layer is used for sound effects that play immediately
in response to an event in the game.  For example, you could play
a sound effect in the foreground when the player opens a door in the
game.


<p>For the sake of completeness, we should mention that the sound
system was <i>designed</i> with the idea in mind that some operating
systems might not be able to handle playback of four tracks at the
same time.  Currently, <b>all</b> of the actual versions of HTML TADS
(the Windows version, and HyperTADS on the Mac) easily handle full
simultaneous playback, so this limitation doesn't exist in practice
today.  If HTML TADS were ever ported to a less capable system, though
- and this is unlikely - here's what would happen: sounds in the
"front" layer(s) would temporarily preempt sounds in the "rear"
layers, to the extent necessary to stay within the system's limits for
simultaneous playback.  The ordering of the layers from front to back
is foreground, ambient, background ambient, and background.  Here's an
example.  Suppose that you're running on a system that can only play
back one sound at a time.  You have some music playing in the background
layer, and somewhere in the middle of the music track, you play a
short sound effect (a creaky door opening, say) in the foreground
layer.  Because of the OS limit of one sound at a time, playing the
creaky door effect would momentarily interrupt the background music,
and then start it up again where it left off as soon as the creaky
door ends.  We emphasize that in practice, you should never have to
worry about this, since there are no existing ports with this limit
and we don't foresee porting to any such systems in the future.

<h4>Queueing</h4>

<p>Sound is an inherently time-based medium.  Text adventures, in
contrast, are essentially static, except to the extent that the game
state evolves in bursts in response to commands from the player.  To
bridge this gap, HTML TADS provides automatic management of the time
domain.  You simply specify which sounds are to be played and in what
order, and HTML TADS takes care of the timing details.

<p>At any given time, HTML TADS allows one active sound in each layer.
The background sound must be MIDI, MPEG, or Ogg Vorbis and the
bgambient, ambient, and foreground sounds must be WAV, MPEG, or Ogg
Vorbis.

<p>Within a layer, sounds are queued.  This means that sounds play
sequentially, in the order that you specify the sounds.  When you
start a sound, you specify how it interacts with other queued sounds
and how it plays:

<ul>
<li>A sound can interrupt anything currently playing in its
layer.  You might use this, for example, to start new background music
when the player enters a new room.

<li>A sound can wait until the sound currently playing in its layer
is finished.  This is useful if you want several pieces of music
to play while in a room.

<li>A sound can be repeated a certain number of times, or it can be
repeated indefinitely.  You might use this to keep a piece of background
music playing repeatedly as long as the player is in a certain room.

<li>A sound can be played randomly.  You can use this to
provide ambient noises.  For example, you might want the sound of rattling
steam pipes to occur every so often while the player is in a maintenance
tunnel.  You can start several sounds at once this way, causing a
different one of the random sounds to play from time to time; since
the sounds will be chosen randomly, there will be no repetetive
pattern to the playback, which can help create the effect of ambient
background noise.

</ul>

<h3>The &lt;SOUND&gt; tag</h3>

The sound features of HTML TADS are activated using a new tag,
&lt;SOUND&gt;.  This new tag is not an element of the standard
HTML definition; this is a TADS extension.

<p>
Attributes of the SOUND tag specify the action that the SOUND
tag should perform.

<p> The SRC attribute specifies the name of the resource containing
the sound data.  The resource name must end in <tt>.WAV</tt> for a
wave file; <tt>.MID</tt> or <tt>.MIDI</tt> for a MIDI file;
<tt>.MPG</tt>, <tt>.MP2</tt>, or <tt>.MP3</tt> for an MPEG audio file;
and <tt>.OGG</tt> for an Ogg Vorbis file.  Refer to <a
href="res.htm">Using Resources in HTML TADS</a> for information on how
to include resource files in your game.

<p> The LAYER attribute specifies the layer containing the sound.
The value of the LAYER attribute must be FOREGROUND, BGAMBIENT,
AMBIENT, or BACKGROUND.  Although you should always specify a
layer for each sound, HTML TADS can sometimes infer the correct
LAYER attribute for a sound based on its other attributes:

<ul>
<li>A .MIDI resource is always in the BACKGROUND layer.
<li>A .WAV resource is always in the BGAMBIENT, AMBIENT, or FOREGROUND layer.
<li>A sound that uses a RANDOM setting is placed in the AMBIENT layer,
unless it specifies otherwise.
<li>A .WAV resource that doesn't use RANDOM is placed in the
FOREGROUND layer, unless it explicitly states otherwise.
<li>An MPEG resource (.MPG, .MP2, or .MP3) can play in any layer; a layer
must be explicitly specified with the SOUND tag.
<li>An Ogg Vorbis resource (.OGG) can play in any layer; a layer must
be explicitly specified with the SOUND tag.
</ul>

<p>
The RANDOM attribute lets you specify the probability of playing
a sound in the ambient layer.  Usually, you will want a sound in the
ambient layer to be played
randomly from time to time; this attribute specifies the probability
that the sound will be played at any given time.  This attribute takes
a value from 1 to 100.  A low value makes the sound play infrequently;
a value of 100 causes the sound to play at every opportunity (i.e.,
whenever another sound in the same layer isn't playing).

<p>
The REPEAT attribute lets you specify how many times a sound should
play.  This can be used for all layers.  This attribute takes a numeric
value specifying the number of times to play the sound, or a value
of LOOP to indicate that the sound plays repeatedly until cancelled.

<p>
If you don't specify a REPEAT attribute for an ambient sound,
and the sound has a RANDOM setting, the
default REPEAT=LOOP will be used.  If you do specify a REPEAT parameter
for an ambient sound, the sound will be played a maximum of the given
number of times; the sound will still play only when the system randomly
chooses the play it, the probability of which is controlled through the
RANDOM attribute.

<p>
If you specify a REPEAT attribute for a foreground sound, the sound
will be played the given number of times in sequence.

<p>
If you specify a REPEAT attribute for a sound in the background or
bgambient layers, the sound
will be played the given number of times.  The actual sequence in which
the sound is played depends on the SEQUENCE attribute used in the sound
and other background sounds.

<p>
The SEQUENCE attribute is used to control the order of repetition for
a group of background sounds; it's meant primarily for use with the
background and bgambient layers.  The SEQUENCE value can be REPLACE,
RANDOM, or CYCLE.  REPLACE causes the sound to remove any previous
background sounds from the queue when the new sound starts.  RANDOM
leaves any previous sounds in the queue, assuming they have enough
REPEAT cycles remaining; when the new sound is finished, if no
other background sounds are waiting to be played, the system
randomly picks one of the sounds remaining in the queue and plays
it again.  CYCLE is similar to random, but goes back to the first
sound in the queue when the new sound is done.

<p>
You can use SEQUENCE to provide transitions with the music.  For
example, you could specify REPEAT=1 for introductory music, then
specify REPEAT=LOOP and SEQUENCE=RANDOM for a set of ongoing
background music.  By using SEQUENCE=RANDOM, you can prevent the
music from becoming too repetitive by randomly varying the order
of the tracks.

<p>
The INTERRUPT attribute (which takes no value) specifies that the
sound is to abort any currently playing sound in the layer and start
the new sound immediately.  You should usually only use INTERRUPT
with foreground sounds.

<p>
The CANCEL attribute turns off all currently queued sounds.  With
no value, a &lt;SOUND CANCEL&gt; tag cancels all queued sounds in
all layers.  You could use this, for example, when switching to a
new room, to turn off all sounds.  You can also specify a layer
with CANCEL to specify that sounds in that particular layer are
to be cancelled; the layer values FOREGROUND, AMBIENT, and
BACKGROUND are allowed.  For example: &lt;SOUND CANCEL=AMBIENT&gt;
cancels only the sounds in the ambient layer.

<p>The ALT attribute lets you specify a textual description of
the sound.  This could be used by a version of the interpreter that
doesn't support sound to display a description of the sound (the
Windows version of the interpreter currently ignores this attribute).

<p>The FADEIN and FADEOUT attributes let you fade the track in at the
beginning and/or fade it out at the end, as described in detail <a
href="#fades">below</a>.  The duration of the fade, in seconds, is
given as the value of the attribute.  The duration can have a
fractional part: for example, FADEIN=2.5 means that the track fades in
over two and a half seconds.

<p>When a sound is repeated with the REPEAT attribute, the fade-in
applies only to the first iteration, and the fade-out applies only to
the last iteration.  The main use for REPEAT is to construct ambient
background music or atmospheric effects that loop indefinitely, and
for that you want the playback to be continuous, without gaps between
loop iterations.  If you're using a looping track where you
specifically want a fade gap between repeats, you can simply prepare
the track itself to include fading at each end as part of the actual
digitized music or sound, and omit the FADEIN and FADEOUT attributes
in the HTML playback.

<p>The VOLUME attribute lets you set the relative playback volume for
a sound.  The value is an integer ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 is
complete silence, 100 is the full, unattenuated level as recorded in
the sound file, and values in between are proportionally reduced
volume, akin to using a speaker volume dial.  (Values outside the
0-100 range are invalid.)  VOLUME only affects the track it applies
to: it doesn't change the physical speaker volume level of the
computer, it doesn't affect any other tracks that might be playing
concurrently in the game, and it doesn't persist for subsequent tracks
played in the same layer.  The purpose of VOLUME is to let you control
the relative loudness of sounds when you're playing back multiple
tracks at the same time, to achieve the mixing effect you intend.

<p>VOLUME and FADEIN/FADEOUT work together in the obvious way.  The
VOLUME setting is used as the "base" volume for the main part of the
track's playback, so a fade-in gradually increases the loudness from
silence to this base level, and a fade-out gradually decreases the
loudness from the base level to silence.  So, the VOLUME setting is
essentially a "master volume" for the track, and the fades are applied
relative to this overall base level.

<p>Note that not all HTML TADS interpreters support audio fades or
volume levels; interpreters that don't will simply ignore these
attributes.

<h3><a name="fades">Fades</a></h3>

<p>An audio "fade" is a gradual change of playback volume from silence
to full volume (a "fade in"), or from full volume to silence (a "fade
out"), usually over an interval of a couple of seconds.  Fades are
useful for smoothing out transitions between tracks - one track fades
out, and then the next track fades in.

<p>A fade only affects the track it applies to.  Fades don't alter the
audio volume for the whole computer or for the whole game - they just
control the volume for one track at a time.  If you fade in a track in
the foreground layer, for example, the volume of a track playing
concurrently in the background layer won't be affected.

<p>The Windows version of HTML TADS supports audio fades, starting
with release HT-21.  Older Windows versions (and some versions on
other platforms) can't do fades, but fade attributes won't do any harm
even so - they'll just be ignored if a user plays your game with an
older version that doesn't support fades.  The systemInfo() function
(available in both TADS 2 and TADS 3) lets you check the interpreter
capabilities to see if fading is supported.

<p>HTML TADS provides five basic fading modes, all controlled through
the FADEIN and FADEOUT attributes of the &lt;SOUND&gt; tag.

<p><b>1. Fade in at the start of a track.</b> When you start a new
sound, you can make it fade in gradually (from silence to full volume)
as it starts playing, by including the FADEIN attribute in the
&lt;SOUND&gt; tag for the new track.  Specify FADEIN=<i>seconds</i>,
giving the duration in seconds of the fade-in.  As the track starts
playing, the volume will be gradually increased over the period you
specify.  Here's an example:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND SRC="song.mp3" FADEIN=1.75&gt;
</pre>

<p>This makes the track fade in over 1.75 seconds.  Note that you
can use a decimal point to specify a fractional number of seconds.

<p><b>2. Fade out at the end of a track.</b> When you start a new
sound, you can also tell it to fade out gradually (from full volume
to silence) just before it finishes playing, by including the
FADEOUT attribute.

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND SRC="song.mp3" FADEOUT=2.5&gt;
</pre>

<p>This says that the track should start fading out at two and a half
seconds before the end of the track, so that it's down to zero volume
just as it ends.

<p>You can combine FADEIN and FADEOUT, if you want the track to fade
in at the beginning and fade out as it finishes:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND SRC="song.mp3" FADEIN=1.75 FADEOUT=2.5&gt;
</pre>

<p>The durations of the two fades don't have to be the same.

<p>Note that the FADEOUT setting applies <i>only</i> when the track
plays all the way to the end.  If you use &lt;SOUND CANCEL&gt; or
&lt;SOUND INTERRUPT&gt; to stop the track before it plays all the way
through, the fade-out mode of the <b>new</b> tag (the CANCEL or
INTERRUPT) will apply instead.

<p><b>3. Cross-fade between two tracks.</b> As we've just seen, you
can smooth out the transition between tracks by fading out at the end
of the old track and fading in at the start of the new one.  Sometimes
you might prefer an even smoother transition - one that doesn't have
an abrupt cut-off in one track and jump to another, but one that also
doesn't have a fade-out/fade-in gap.  One way to do this is with a
"cross-fade."  This is an effect where the old sound fades out while
the new sound <i>simultaneously</i> fades in.  Because the two fades
overlap, and ramp their volumes in opposite directions, the apparent
volume level stays about the same throughout the transition.  This
means there's no obvious fade, but also no abrupt end to one sound or
start to the other; the first track just subtly flows into the second.
Audio cross-fades are often used in movies at scene transitions, and
they can be useful in similar situations in TADS games.

<p>To create a cross-fade in HTML TADS, you can qualify the FADEIN
or FADEOUT attributes with the CROSSFADE keyword.  Rather than
saying FADEIN=<i>time</i>, you write FADEIN=CROSSFADE,<i>time</i>.
For example:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND SRC="song.mp3" FADEIN=CROSSFADE,1.5 FADEOUT=CROSSFADE,1.5&gt
</pre>

<p>When you specify FADEIN=CROSSFADE,<i>time</i>, the new track will
cross-fade with the <i>preceding</i> track as the preceding track
ends.  This will automatically add a fade-out to the old track of the
same duration as the fade-in for the new track - it's effectively as
though you had specified FADEOUT=CROSSFADE,<i>time</i> on the old
track, even if you didn't actually do so.

<p>When you include FADEOUT=CROSSFADE,<i>time</i>, the current track
(i.e, the one with the FADEOUT=CROSSFADE) will cross-fade with the
<i>next</i> track as the current track ends.  The current track will
start fading out at <i>time</i> seconds before its normal end, and the
next track will start playing immediately, overlapping the fade-out of
the old track.  The next track simply starts normally - it is <i>not</i>
automatically faded.  If you want the next track to fade in during
the cross-fade period, you have to explicitly say so with a FADEIN
attribute in its &lt;SOUND&gt; tag.

<p>Note that FADEIN cross-fades won't work with random sounds.  The
reason is that, in random mode, the system waits until it's actually
time to play the next track to choose which track to play.  At that
point, if the new track has a FADEIN=CROSSFADE setting, it's too late
to apply it, since the previous track has already finished.  The
correct way to handle cross-fades with random sounds is to use FADEOUT
cross-fades instead - these work even in random mode because they
apply at the end of a track, after the random selection has been made.

<p>Similarly, FADEIN cross-fades won't work with the last track in a
loop (with CYCLE).  Even though it would seem like the system should
have enough notice in this case, it doesn't: there's no way to know
for sure that you won't add another track just before the last track
in the queue finishes, so the system can't be sure you want to apply
the cross-fade to the first queued track when looping back.  Again,
the correct approach is to use FADEOUT cross-fades for this situation.

<p><b>4. Cancel a track in mid-play, with fade-out.</b> If you want to
interrupt a track before it finishes, you use the CANCEL attribute as
described earlier.  Normally, CANCEL just abruptly cuts off the
playing track.  This can be jarring to a listener, especially for
something like ongoing background music.  It's often better to use a
fade-out on the old sound.  You can do this by combining the FADEOUT
attribute with CANCEL:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND CANCEL=BACKGROUND FADEOUT=1.5&gt;
</pre>

<p>This tells TADS to immediately start fading out the sound currently
playing in the background layer, reducing it to zero volume over the
next second and a half.  When the fade is finished, the sound is
stopped, just as with a normal CANCEL, meaning that a new sound
(specified with a new &lt;SOUND&gt; tag) as soon as the fade-out
finishes.  Note that you don't have to wait until the fade-out
finishes to write out the &lt;SOUND&gt; tag for the next track - you
can write out the new tag immediately, and TADS will put the new sound
in the queue, to start as soon as the outgoing fade finishes.

<p><b>5. Cancel a track in mid-play, with cross-fade.</b> You can
use the cross-fade capability when interrupting a track.  As we've
just seen, the normal behavior when you use CANCEL and FADEOUT
together is to start fading the current sound, and wait until the
fade finishes to start any subsequent track.  However, if you
use the CROSSFADE qualifier, the next track will be able to start
playing back immediately, while the current track's fade-out
proceeds.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;SOUND CANCEL=BACKGROUND FADEOUT=CROSSFADE,1.5&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This causes the current background sound to start fading out,
and then allows a subsequent &lt;SOUND&gt; tag to start playback
immediately, overlapping the fade-out on the old sound.  Note that
the new sound must have its own FADEIN attribute if you want a
fade-in on the new track; otherwise the new sound will simply
start at full volume on top of the fading-out old track.

<p>You can also use &lt;SOUND SRC=<i>file</i> FADEIN=CROSSFADE,<i>time</i>
INTERRUPT&gt; to cancel the currently playing track and start a new
track, all in one tag.  If you use this method, the new track starts
playing immediately, with a fade-in of the specified duration, and the
old track simultaneously fades out over the same period.  (Note that
if this tag <i>also</i> has a FADEOUT attribute, that value applies
only to the <b>new</b> track; the old track's fade-out duration is
still controlled by the new track's FADEIN.  The point is to make the
overlapping fades of the same duration, so that the volume level stays
roughly constant across the transition.)

<p>These two methods (CANCEL plus a new sound tag, and the all-in-one
INTERRUPT) have almost identical effects - they both make the old
sound start fading out immediately, and they both perform the fade in
the background, allowing a new track to be played concurrently while
the old one is fading.  The second method is a little easier to use
because you only need one tag for the whole transition.  The first
method, however, gives you a little more control, since it lets you
specify the fade-out time for the old track separately from the
fade-in time for the new track.  In fact, you don't even have to
specify a fade-in for the new track, which might be desirable if the
new track's contents already start with a fade-in.

<h3>Fades with REPEAT</h3>

<p>The REPEAT attribute is designed for creating ambient background
music or atmospheric effects, by combining one or more segments into
a loop that plays indefinitely.  Since the point is to create an
ongoing background track, we don't want any obvious gaps between
the segments.  As a result, we don't want any fades
between segments.

<p>To accomplish this, TADS only applies the FADEIN attribute to the
first repetition of a repeated sound, and only applies FADEOUT to the
last repetition.

<p>If you're using a group of tracks with SEQUENCE=LOOP or
SEQUENCE=RANDOM, here's how fades are handled.  FADEIN gets no special
treatment, but it doesn't really need it: you should simply be sure
not to use FADEIN for any tracks other than the first track of the
group.  FADEIN will still only apply to the first iteration of the
first track, just as for a single repeated track, so the first track
won't fade in again when playback loops back (with SEQUENCE=LOOP) or
selects the first track again at random (with SEQUENCE=RANDOM).  For
FADEOUT, TADS looks at the queue just before starting each sound to
see if there are any other sounds pending.  If so, it ignores the
FADEOUT parameter of the new track, since one of the other tracks will
presumably start playing as soon as the new track ends.

<p>If you actually want fades between adjacent segments of repeated
tracks, you can't get this effect using FADEIN and FADEOUT, but there's
a simple trick you can use to work around this.  Just edit your audio
files so that the tracks themselves fade in at the beginning and
fade out at the end.


<h3>Sound in Banner Windows</h3>

<p>&lt;SOUND&gt; tags are only allowed to appear in the main game
window.  They are allowed to appear within &lt;BANNER&gt; tags, but
note that sounds played from within &lt;BANNER&gt; tags are still
effectively part of the main window, and must coordinate with the
main window for timing and layer sharing.

<p>&lt;SOUND&gt; tags <b>may not</b> appear in TADS 3 banner API
windows.  Any sound tags that are displayed in banner API windows will
simply be ignored.

<h3>Clearing the Screen</h3>

<p>Because the &lt;SOUND&gt; tag is part of the formatting information
that makes up the display window, sounds are conceptually part of the
page on which they appear.  This means that all sounds are cancelled
as soon as you clear the screen using the <tt>clearscreen()</tt> function.

<p>If you want to perform full-screen animation or other effects that
require erasing the display, but you want your sounds to continue
playing, you must use a <a href='banners.htm'>banner</a> for the
animation.  A banner lets you replace the information displayed on
part of the screen without clearing the entire window.  Note that you
can use a banner that covers the entire display window (by using the
HEIGHT=100% attribute) if you want to use the entire window for your
animated effects.

<h3>Portability</h3>

<p>At the time of this writing, the MIDI, WAV, and MPEG audio formats
are supported on both the 32-bit Windows and the
Macintosh versions of HTML TADS.  Ogg Vorbis is currently supported
only on Windows, although Macintosh support is expected soon.

<p>If and when other HTML TADS ports appear, it is likely that some
of the audio features will be supported, but it is possible that not
all of the formats will be available.  Sound requires specialized
hardware; not all computers have any sound capabilities, although
most reasonably modern machines do.  The sound resource formats that
HTML TADS supports are not universal standards, but they are very
widely used de facto standards and hence are widely supported. It is
possible, though, that some future ports will not have access to
support libraries for all of the audio formats.

<p>
As a game author, you should consider the trade-offs in
using sound in your game.  If you want to use sound, you should
keep in mind that some players will be using systems that don't
provide sound support, and some will choose to play with sounds
turned off.

<p>
Fortunately, in an adventure game, it's relatively easy to use sound
as an enhancement rather than as a crucial feature of the game.
One of the primary benefits of using sound in a game is that it
can add to the atmosphere and mood of the game; even though this type
of sound can add a lot to the game, it can be be omitted without ruining
the game, since the game will still be fully playable.

<p>
Unless you don't mind limiting your audience, you should be careful
to avoid using sound effects that provide crucial information.  Whenever
you use a sound effect as a clue, you should add some textual description
of the sound as well, so that the game is still playable without sound.
