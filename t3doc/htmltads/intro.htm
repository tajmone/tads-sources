<h3>What is HTML TADS?</h3>

HTML TADS is an interpreter for games created with TADS, the Text
Adventure Development System.  HTML TADS is an extension of the
standard TADS interpreter that allows a game author to use HTML
markups to control the appearance of the game.

<p>
HTML TADS is simply a different user interface on the standard TADS
interpreter engine.  You create a game for use with HTML TADS in
the same way as with the standard TADS; the only difference is
that you can use HTML markups to format the text of your game.

<p>
HTML TADS allows a TADS game to use many features that have not
traditionally been available in text adventure systems:

<ul>
<li>Fancy text formatting.  HTML TADS allows you to use most of the
features of HTML to format your text.  Whereas plain TADS only has a few
very limited formatting features, HTML TADS allows you to set
fonts and font sizes, text colors, background colors, and all sorts
of text attributes like boldface, italics, and underlining.

<li>Graphics.  HTML TADS lets you to integrate graphics into your
game.  You can use a picture for the window background, and you
can insert pictures into the text, with various alignment possibilities.
Unlike some older adventure game systems that divided the screen into
panels, some of which showed text and others of which showed graphics,
HTML TADS uses the much more natural approach of intermixing text
and graphics freely.  The Web has demonstrated how effective graphics
can be when used this way.

<li>Music and sound effects.  With HTML TADS, you can play MIDI music
files, WAV-format digitized sound effects, MPEG 2.0 Audio files (such
as MP3's), and Ogg Vorbis (a compressed digital sound format similar
to MP3, but developed as an open-source project, and said to have
compression and fidelity characteristics superior to MP3).  It's
extremely easy to play music and sound from within your game, because
you access these features through HTML tags; HTML TADS automatically
takes care of all of the queuing and timing issues.

<li>Hypertext.  HTML TADS allows you to set up hyperlinks in your
text and pictures; these hyperlinks contain commands that are
activated when the user clicks on them.  This lets you set up a
game that can be played with a lot less typing, since a user can,
for example, click on the name of an item in a room description to
see more information on the item.

<li>More control over the screen layout.  HTML TADS lets you define
"banners," which are subwindows that you can arrange around the edges
of the main game window.  Banners don't scroll with the main window,
and you can update the contents of a banner at any time, so you can
use banners to display dynamic information in parallel with the main
game window.  Banners give you the basic functionality of the status
line in the traditional character-mode version of TADS, but open up
numerous new possibilities as well.  (In TADS 3, banners are
controlled through a function-call interface rather than with HTML
codes.)

<h3>What software do I need?</h3>

<p>If you've installed the TADS Author's Kit for Windows, you already
have everything you need to create and run HTML TADS games.  If not,
you'll need the following software:

<ul>
<li>The standard TADS compiler, version 2.2.5 or higher.  You use exactly
the same compiler to produce HTML TADS games and normal TADS games.

<li>The HTML TADS interpreter.
</ul>

<p>You might also want TADS Workbench, if you're using Windows.  This
is a development environment that integrates the interactive TADS
Debugger with the full HTML TADS display environment, facilitating
debugging and testing of games that use HTML formatting.  This is
included in the TADS Author's Kit.

<p>If you're using TADS 2, you'll also want the <i>TADS Author's
Manual</i>, which provides information on how to develop a game with
TADS.  You should be able to get the <i>Author's Manual</i> in
electronic form from the same place you got TADS; try the Interactive
Fiction Archive at ftp.ifarchive.org (<a
href='ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/tads2'>
ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/tads2</a>) if you're
not sure where to look.  The manual is also available on the Web in
HTML format (thanks to Neil K. Guy, who converted the manual from the
original TeX version) at <a
href='http://www.tela.bc.ca/tela/tads-manual/'>
http://www.tela.bc.ca/tela/tads-manual/</a>.  You may also want to get
a book on HTML version 3.2, so that you can learn how to use HTML to
format your game's display.

<p>If you're using TADS 3, you'll want the User's Manuals.  These are
bundled with the "full documentation" version of the TADS 3 Author's
Kit, or can be downloaded separately.  You should be able to find
these at the <a href='http://www.ifarchive.org/'>IF Archive</a>
or through the <a href='http://www.tads.org/'>tads.org</a> site.

<p>Once you have the software and manuals you need, refer to <a
href='start.htm'>Getting Started with HTML TADS</a> for an
introduction to using the HTML features in HTML TADS.

<p>
Since HTML TADS is an extension to the normal TADS, you can use what
you already know about TADS to write a HTML TADS game -- refer
to <a href='convert.htm'>Converting a Game to HTML TADS</a> for
information about how to put HTML features in your existing TADS games.

<a name="compatibility"></a>
<h3>Compatibility between HTML TADS and standard TADS</h3>

<p>
HTML TADS is an extension of the standard TADS.  The core language
system is the same in both versions; the only difference is the way
the two systems interpret and display text.  Even though HTML TADS
uses a very different display system than the standard TADS, the
two versions are highly compatible.

<p>
<b>Playing standard TADS games with the HTML interpreter:</b>
HTML TADS is fully compatible with games written for the standard
TADS.  Standard games will naturally not take full advantage of the
HTML features, but HTML TADS interprets all of the standard
TADS formatting codes correctly.  With a standard TADS game, HTML
TADS simply acts as a Windows version of the interpreter.

<p>
<b>Playing HTML-enabled games with the standard interpreter:</b>
Recent versions (2.2.4 or higher) of the standard TADS interpreter
also provide a degree of compatibility with games written for
HTML TADS.  Refer to <a href='charmode.htm'>this document</a>
for details.


<a name="whither"></a>
<h3>Whither the standard TADS?</h3>

I don't want to use terms like "old-style" to describe existing,
non-HTML TADS games, because HTML TADS is just one variation of TADS;
the standard TADS will continue to exist, and some authors may choose
to write new games using the standard TADS system.  HTML TADS is
not yet implemented on as many operating systems as the
standard TADS interpreter, and probably won't ever be as widely
ported as the standard TADS interpreter due to its additional complexity.
As a result, some authors will want to use the standard
system so that their game can be played by more people.

<p>
I plan on continuing to support the standard TADS; fortunately,
supporting both the HTML and standard versions will will involve very
little additional work beyond only the HTML version.  HTML TADS uses exactly
the same interpreter engine as the standard TADS; the only difference
is in the user interface code.  So, as changes are made to the
TADS language and the interpreter system, they'll more or less
automatically show up at the same time in the standard and HTML
versions of TADS.  The only area that will probably receive less
attention than it would have in the absence of HTML TADS is in
enhancing the standard TADS DOS interpreter environment's user
interface; however, because of the widespread deployment of the
TADS interpreter, the user interface has been essentially frozen for
several years anyway, so this isn't really going to change anything.

<a name=why></a>
<h3>Why HTML?</h3>

<p>
One of the main improvements that TADS authors have been requesting for
some time is more control over formatting, ideally including support
for graphics and sound.  There are many ways I could have added
these features, but the emergence of HTML as a ubiquitous text formatting
language made it a clear choice.

<p> HTML is a "markup language" that's become widely used, thanks to
the popularity of the World Wide Web.  HTML documents are text files
that have embedded "markups," which are special sequences within the
text that specify formatting commands.  The language has been refined
over several years based on the experiences and needs of a vast number
of users, and it's proved to be very flexible and useful.

<p>
I chose HTML as the new formatting language for TADS
because of these advantages.  I didn't want to invent a new markup
language; even though HTML isn't perfect, it would be difficult
to do so much better that it would justify the work of creating
a new language and the cost to game authors of learning a
new language.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p> HTML TADS incorporates several high-quality third-party libraries
that made possible some of its sophisticated graphical features.  In
particular, HTML TADS incorporates the work of the Independent JPEG
Group; the PNG Reference Library, developed by Andreas Dilger, Guy
Eric Schalnat, and other Contributing Authors; the ZLIB compression
library, written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler; and, in the
Windows version, the amp MPEG audio decoder by Tomislav Uzelac; the
libvorbis reference Ogg Vorbis decoder by Xiphophorus; and the
reference MNG library, libmng, by Gerard Juyn.  The author would like
to express his appreciation to the developers of these libraries for
their fine work and their generosity in making their work freely
available.

<p>
The author would like to thank everyone who has offered bug reports,
suggestions, advice, and encouragement during the course of this project.
All of your ideas have made this a much better system than it ever could
have been otherwise.

<p>
For their comments and suggestions during the HTML TADS
development process, the author wishes to express his appreciation
to David Baggett and Andrew Plotkin.
For their help and patience testing early versions of the software,
I'd also like to thank G. Kevin Wilson and Neil deMause.

<p> Special thanks go to Chris Nebel, for first suggesting to me the
idea of using HTML as a formatting language for text adventures, and
for his work porting TADS to the Macintosh; and to Iain Merrick and
Andrew Pontious, for bringing HyperTADS to Macintosh.  Finally, I'd
especially like to thank Neil K. Guy, author of <i>The Golden
Skull</i> and of the acclaimed 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition
entry <i>Six Stories</i>, and Stephen Granade, author of the
delightful and award-winning 1998 IF Competition entry
<i>Arrival</i>, for their pioneering work with this software, as well
as their long-standing generosity in sharing their TADS expertise
with other game authors.
