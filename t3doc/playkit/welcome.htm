<h1>Welcome to the TADS Player Kit</h1>


<p> Thanks for installing the TADS Player Kit!  This kit has everything
you need to play games written with TADS.  It works with games created
using TADS 2 and TADS 3.

<hr>


<h2>How to start a game</h2>

<p>To run a TADS game, go to the Windows Start menu, click on <b>TADS</b>,
and then click on <b>HTML TADS Interpreter</b>.

<p>When the Interpreter window appears, you can click on the
<b>Browse for Games</b> button, or use the menus to
select <b>File</b> | <b>Open</b>.

<p>Now just select the .gam or .t3 file for the game you want to play.

<p>(To play a TADS game you find on the Internet, simply download it
onto your computer's hard disk first, then select the downloaded
file as we just described.)



<h2>Where to find TADS games</h2>

<p><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/">IFDB</a>, the Interactive Fiction
Database, has listings for thousands of Interactive Fiction titles,
with descriptions, user reviews, recommendations, and download links.
You can find most TADS games that have ever been released, along with
games for other IF authoring systems.

<p>The central distribution hub for IF is the
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>.  The Archive has
the Internet's most extensive public collection of material related to
Interactive Fiction, including games, books, articles, and programming
systems.  TADS games are collected in the directory
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXtads.html">
if-archive/games/tads/</a>.


<h2>Learn more about TADS</h2>

<p>For TADS news, information, manuals, and downloads, visit the
official TADS Web site,
<a href='http://www.tads.org'>www.tads.org</a>.

<p>The TADS site also has links to the Interactive Fiction
community and other IF resources, such as discussion forums, blogs,
and other IF authoring systems.


<h2>Write your own game</h2>

<p>If you'd like to write your own Interactive Fiction, you can find
the full TADS Author's Kit on
<a href="http://www.tads.org">tads.org</a>.  The Author's Kit is free
and has everything you need to create original IF with TADS.

<h2>Problems?</h2>

<p>If you run into any problems with TADS, check the
<a href='../compat.htm'>system compatibility notes</a>.  There are a
few known problems with certain Windows configurations, and the notes
explain how to fix these.  You should read the compatibility notes in
particular if:

<ul>
  <li>HTML TADS is crashing;
  <li>you're using Wine;
  <li>you're using a non-English version of Windows.
</ul>
