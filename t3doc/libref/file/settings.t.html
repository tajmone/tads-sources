 <p>   TADS 3 Library - settings file management <p>   This is a framework that the library uses to keep track of certain   preference settings - things like the NOTIFY, FOOTNOTES, and EXITS   settings. <p>   The point of this framework is "global" settings - settings that apply   not just to a particular game, but to all games that have a particular   feature.  Things like NOTIFY, FOOTNOTES, and some other such features   are part of the standard library, so they tend to be available in most   games.  Furthermore, they tend to work more or less the same way in   most games.  As a result, a given player will probably prefer to set   the options a particular way for most or all games.  If a player   doesn't like score notification, she'll probably dislike it across the   board, not just in certain games. <p>   This module provides the internal, programmatic core for managing   global preferences.  There's no UI in this part of the implementation;   the adv3 library layers the UI on top via the settingsUI object, but   other alternative UIs could be built using the API provided here. <p>   The framework is extensible - there's an easy, structured way for   library extensions and games to add their own configuration variables   that will be automatically managed by the framework.  All you have to   do to create a new configuration variable is to create a SettingsItem   object to represent it.  Once you've created the object, the library   will automatically find it and manage it for you. <p>   This module is designed to be separable from the adv3 library, so that   alternative libraries or stand-alone (non-library-based) games can   reuse it.  This file has no dependencies on anything in adv3 (at   least, it shouldn't).
