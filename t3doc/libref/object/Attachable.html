   An Attachable is an object that can be attached to another, using an   ATTACH X TO Y command.  This is a mix-in class that is meant to be   combined with a Thing-derived class to create an attachable object. <p>   Attachment is symmetrical: we can only attach to other Attachable   objects.  As a result, the verb handling for ATTACH can be performed   symmetrically - ATTACH X TO Y is handled the same way as ATTACH Y TO   X.  Sometimes reversing the roles makes the command nonsensical, but   when the reversal makes sense, it seems unlikely that it'll ever   change the meaning of the command.  This makes it program the verb   handling, because it means that we can designate one of X or Y as the   handler for the verb, and just write the code once there.  Refer to   the handleAttach() method to see how this works. <p>   There's an important detail that we leave to instances, because   there's no good general rule we can implement.  Specifically, there's   the matter of imposing appropriate constraints on the relative   locations of objects once they're attached to one another.  There are   numerous anomalies that become possible once two objects are attached.   Consider the example of a battery connected to a jumper cable that's   in turn connected to a lamp: <p>   - if we put the battery in a box but leave the lamp outside the box,   we shouldn't be able to close the lid of the box all the way without   breaking the cables <p>   - if we're carrying the battery but not the lamp, traveling to a new   room should drag the lamp along <p>   - if we drop the battery down a well, the lamp should be dragged down   with it <p>   Our world model isn't sophisticated enough to properly model an   attachment relationship, so it can't deal with these contingencies by   proper physical simulation.  Which is why we have to leave these for   the game to handle. <p>   There are two main strategies you can apply to handle these problems. <p>   First, you can impose limits that prevent these sorts of situations   from coming up in the first place, either by carefully designing the   scenario so they simply don't come up, or by imposing more or less   artificial constraints.  For example, you could solve all of the   problems above by eliminating the jumper cable and attaching the lamp   directly to the battery, or by making the jumper cable very short.   Anything attached to the battery would effectively become located "in"   the battery, so it would move everywhere along with the battery   automatically.  Detaching the lamp would move the lamp back outside   the battery, and conversely, moving the lamp out of the battery would   detach the objects. <p>   Second, you can detect the anomalous cases and handle them explicitly   with special-purpose code.  You could use beforeAction and afterAction   methods on one of the attached objects, for example, to detect the   various problematic actions, either blocking them or implementing   appropriate consequences. <p>   Given the number of difficult anomalies possible with rope-like   objects, the second approach is challenging on its own.  However, it   often helps to combine it with the first approach, limiting the   scenario.  In other words, you'd limit the scenario to some extent,   but not totally: rather than completely excising the difficult   behavior, you'd narrow it down to a manageable subset of the full   range of real-world possibilities; then, you'd deal with the remaining   anomalies on a case-by-case basis.  For example, you could make the   battery too heavy to carry, which would guarantee that it would never   be put in a box, thrown down a well, or carried out of the room.  That   would only leave a few issues: walking away while carrying the plugged   in lamp, which could be handled with an afterAction that severs the   attachment; putting the lamp in a box and closing the box, which could   be handled with a beforeAction by blocking Close actions whenever the   lamp is inside the object being closed.

This routine is called on   BOTH the direct and indirect object during the attachment process   - that is, it's called on the direct object with the indirect   object as the argument, and then it's called on the indirect   object with the direct object as the argument. <p>   This symmetrical handling makes it easy to handle the frequent   cases where the player might say ATTACH X TO Y or ATTACH Y TO X   and mean the same thing either way.  Because this method is called   for both X and Y in either phrasing, you can simply choose to   write the handler code in either X or Y - you only have to write   it once, because the handler will be called on each of the   objects, regardless of the phrasing.  So, if you choose to   designate X as the official ATTACH handler, write a handleAttach()   method on X, and leave the one on Y doing nothing: during   execution, the X method will do its work, and the Y method will do   nothing, so regardless of phrasing order, the net result will be   the same. <p>   By default we do nothing.
