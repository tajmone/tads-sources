   "Bag of Holding."  This is a mix-in that actively moves items from the   holding actor's direct inventory into itself when the actor's hands   are too full. <p>   The bag of holding offers a solution to the conflict between "realism"   and playability.  On the one hand, in real life, you can only hold so   many items at once, so at first glance it seems a simulation ought to   have such a limit in order to be more realistic.  On the other hand,   most players justifiably hate having to deal with a carrying limit,   because it forces the player to spend a lot of time doing tedious   inventory management. <p>   The Bag of Holding is a compromise solution.  The concept is borrowed   from live role-playing games, where it's usually a magical item that   can hold objects of unlimited size and weight, thereby allowing   characters to transport impossibly large objects.  In text IF, a bag   of holding isn't usually magical - it's usually just something like a   large backpack, or a trenchcoat with lots of pockets.  And it usually   isn't meant as a solution to an obvious puzzle; rather, it's meant to   invisibly prevent inventory management from becoming a puzzle in the   first place, by shuffling objects out of the PC's hands automatically   to free up space as needed. <p>   This Bag of Holding implementation works by automatically moving   objects from an actor's hands into the bag object, whenever the actor   needs space to pick up a new item.  Whenever an action has a   "roomToHoldObj" precondition, the precondition will automatically look   for a BagOfHolding object within the actor's inventory, and then move   as many items as necessary from the actor's hands to the bag.

This is an indication of   how strongly this bag wants to contain the object.  The affinity   is a number in arbitrary units; higher numbers indicate stronger   affinities.  An affinity of zero means that the bag does not want   to contain the object at all. <p>   The purpose of the affinity is to support specialized holders   that are designed to hold only specific types of objects, and   allow these specialized holders to implicitly gather their   specific objects.  For example, a key ring might only hold keys,   so it would have a high affinity for keys and a zero affinity for   everything else.  A lunchbox might have a higher affinity for   things like sandwiches than for anything else, but might be   willing to serve as a general container for other small items as   well. <p>   The units of affinity are arbitrary, but the library uses the   following values for its own classes: <p>   0 - no affinity at all; the bag cannot hold the object <p>   50 - willing to hold the object, but not of the preferred type <p>   100 - default affinity; willing and able to hold the object, but   just as willing to hold most other things <p>   200 - special affinity; this object is of a type that we   especially want to hold <p>   We intentionally space these loosely so that games can use   intermediate levels if desired. <p>   When we are looking for bags of holding to consolidate an actor's   directly-held inventory, note that we always move the object with   the highest bag-to-object affinity out of all of the objects   under consideration.  So, if you want to give a particular kind   of bag priority so that the library uses that bag before any   other bag, make this routine return a higher affinity for the   bag's objects than any other bags do. <p>   By default, we'll return the default affinity of 100.   Specialized bags that don't hold all types of objects must   override this to return zero for objects they can't hold. <p>
