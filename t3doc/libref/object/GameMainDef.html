   The library base class for the gameMain object. <p>   Each game MUST define an object called 'gameMain' to define how the   game starts up.  You can use GameMainDef as the base class of your   'gameMain' object, in which case the only thing you're required to   specify in your object is the 'initialPlayerChar' property - you can   inherit everything else from the GameMainDef class if you don't   require any further customizations.

We set this   true by default, so that the player can refer to the player   character in either the first or second person, regardless of how   the game refers to the PC. <p>   If desired, the game can set this flag to nil to force the player   to use the correct pronoun to refer to the player character.  We   define "correct" in the case of first or second person as the   complement of what the game uses: if the game calls the PC "me",   the player must say "you", and vice versa.  In a third-person   game, the player must also refer to the PC in the third person. <p>   We set the default to allow using "you" and "me" interchangeably   because (a) this will create no confusion in most games, and (b)   many players would be annoyed otherwise.  For one thing, most   experienced IF players will be rather set in their ways; they'll   be accustomed to using either "me" or "you" (but usually "me") to   refer to the PC, and will tend out of habit to do so even in games   that don't use the traditional second-person narration format.   For another thing, different players have different ideas about   whether the PC is "you" or "me" in input, even in a conventional   second-person game.  Some players think in terms of a conversation   with the narrator, in which case the narrator's "you" is the   player's "me", and vice versa; other players are rather more   literal-minded, assuming that if the game talks about "you" then   so should the player. <p>   Even in games that use first-person or third-person narration, it   seems unlikely that there will be a separate second-person element   to the narration, and as long as that's true, it should cause no   confusion for the game to accept "you" and "me" as equivalent in   commands.  However, the library provides this option in case such   as situation does arise. <p>

This is true by   default, which means that players will be allowed to use ALL with   any command - OPEN ALL, EXAMINE ALL, etc. <p>   Some authors don't like to allow players to use ALL with so many   verbs, because they think it's a sort of "cheating" when players   try things like OPEN ALL.  This option lets you disable ALL for   most verbs; if you set this to nil, only the basic inventory   management verbs (TAKE, TAKE FROM, DROP, PUT IN, PUT ON) will   allow ALL, and other verbs will simply respond with an error   ("'All' isn't allowed with that verb"). <p>   If you're writing an especially puzzle-oriented game, you might   want to set this to nil.  It's a trade-off though, as some people   will think your game is less player-friendly if you disable ALL. <p>

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>ambigAnnounceMode</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/misc.t.html">misc.t</a>[<a href="../source/misc.t.html#499">499</a>]</table><div class=desc>   How should we handle object announcements when an object is   automatically disambiguated?  This controls how an action is   described when the parser uses the logicalness rules to narrow   down the object for a noun phrase when the noun phrase could refer   to multiple in-scope objects.  There are three options: <p>   AnnounceUnclear - Make a parenthetical announcement only when the   choice is *not* clear (as described below).  This is the original   library behavior, from before this option was added. <p>   AnnounceClear - Make a parenthetical announcement (for example,   "(the red door)") for all disambiguated objects, whether clear or   unclear.  We don't make an announcement when there's only one   in-scope object matching the noun phrase - the announcement is   only when multiple objects match the words. <p>   DescribeClear - For *unclear* disambiguation, make a parenthetical   announcement, to emphasize that the parser had to make a choice.   For *clear* disambiguation, skip the announcement, but *do* use a   verbose version of the library message in place of one of the   terse default replies.  For example, for &gt;TAKE BOX, instead of   "Taken", we would reply "You take the green box."  The longer   reply in these cases always mentions the involved object by name,   to make it clear exactly which object we chose to use. <p>   The default setting is DescribeClear. <p>   This only applies when the disambiguation choice is clear - that   is, when there's exactly one in-scope object that passes the   logicalness tests.  For example, if the current location contains   a red door that's open and a green door that's closed, CLOSE DOOR   clearly refers to the red door because the other one is already   closed - it's not logical.  There are other cases where the   disambiguation is a best guess rather than a clear choice, such as   when there are multiple logical objects but there's one that's   more likely than the others due to the logicalRank results.  In   those best-guess situations, the parser always announces its   decision, because it's entirely plausible that the player meant   one of the other logical, but less likely, choices. <p>

However, in many ways it's more logical and   useful to run "check" first.  That way, you can consider the   action to be more or less committed by the time the "before"   notifiers are invoked.  Of course, a command is never *truly*   committed until it's actually been executed, since a "before"   handler could always cancel it.  But this is relatively rare -   "before" handlers usually carry out side effects, so it's very   useful to be able to know that the command has already passed all   of its own internal checks by the time "before" is invoked - that   way, you can invoke side effects without worrying that the command   will subsequently fail. <p>

<a name="cancelCmdLineOnFailure"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>cancelCmdLineOnFailure</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/misc.t.html">misc.t</a>[<a href="../source/misc.t.html#421">421</a>]</table><div class=desc>   When a command fails, should we continue processing any remaining   commands on the same command line, or simply ignore them?  The   reason we might want to ignore additional commands is that they   might not do what the player was expecting if an earlier command   failed; this can sometimes create confusing situations, because   the player expected one effect but got something quite different.   On the other hand, *not* executing all the commands on the command   line could be confusing in its own way, since the game's   assessment of what constitutes "failure" might not be clear to the   player; from the player's perspective, the game might appear to be   inexplicably skipping commands. <p>   There's no perfect solution.  As always, the ideal is to   understand the player's intentions and act accordingly.  But when   a command fails, it's usually because the player's idea of what's   going on is out of sync with the game's - in other words, if we're   in this situation to start with, it's probably because our best   effort to understand the player's intentions has already failed.   This isn't always the case; sometimes we understand the player's   intentions perfectly well, but the command fails anyway because of   some surprising new development.  In these cases, aborting the   rest of the command is arguably the right approach, because the   player will need a chance to reconsider the pre-typed commands in   light of the new information.  In other cases, though, it's not so   clear.  For many players, the prime virtue for the parser is to be   predictable, and the most predictable thing to do is to simply   plow through the rest of the command line in all cases. <p>   Our traditional approach (from the early adv3 versions, and even   in tads 2) has been the simple-minded approach - just keep going   in all cases.  So, we make this the default.  You can abort   remaining commands on a command failure by setting this to true. <p>

As a convenience to the player, we can allow the player to   truncate long words, entering only the first, say, 6 characters.   For example, rather than typing "x flashlight", we could allow the   player to simply type "x flashl" - truncating "flashlight" to six   letters. <p>   We use a default truncation length of 6, but games can change this   by overriding this property in gameMain.  We use a default of 6   mostly because that's what the old Infocom games did - many   long-time IF players are accustomed to six-letter truncation from   those games.  Shorter lengths are superficially more convenient   for the player, obviously, but there's a trade-off, which is that   shorter truncation lengths create more potential for ambiguity.   For some games, a longer length might actually be better for the   player, because it would reduce spurious ambiguity due to the   parser matching short input against long vocabulary words. <p>   If you don't want to allow the player to truncate long words at   all, set this to nil.  This will require the player to type every   word in its entirety. <p>   Note that changing this property dynamicaly will have no effect.   The library only looks at it once, during library initialization   at the very start of the game.  If you want to change the   truncation length dynamically, you must instead create a new   StringComparator object with the new truncation setting, and call   languageGlobals.setStringComparator() to select the new object. <p>

Each score entry is itself a   list of two elements: the first element is the minimum score for   the rank, and the second is a string describing the rank.  The   ranks should be given in ascending order, since we simply search   the list for the first item whose minimum score is greater than   our score, and use the preceding item.  The first entry in the   list would normally have a minimum of zero points, since it   should give the initial, lowest rank. <p>   If this is set to nil, which it is by default, we'll simply skip   score ranks entirely. <p>

If this is set, announcement messages that   list objects by name will add distinguishing details to indicate   specifically which objects are being referred to.  This applies to   messages announcing default objects, vaguely matched objects, and   multiple objects. <p>   A distinguisher is a parser object that tells two objects apart by   some feature that's different in the two objects.  The key thing   is that the difference has some natural language phrasing   associated with it, both on the input side and the output side.   For example, the locational distinguisher can tell two objects   apart if they have different containers, since it can describe the   objects by adding containment phrases like "in the box" or "on the   table". <p>   When this flag is turned on, the parser will try to pick a   distinguisher that can tell apart the specific objects mentioned   in the announcement, from one another or from other objects in   scope, depending on the context.  The point is to help make it   clearer to the player the exact objects being referred to. <p>   Even when this flag is set, the parser tries to minimize the use   of additional distinguishing detail.  The goal is to be natural in   the usage, adding detail only when a human speaker would, which is   when the phrasing would otherwise be ambiguous. <p>   Setting this flag to nil makes the parser simply use the basic   name of each object in an announcement.  You can use this setting   if you find that the distinguisher mode generates too much fussy   detail for your taste. <p>
