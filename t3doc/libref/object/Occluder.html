   Occluder: this is a mix-in class that can be used with multiple   inheritance to combine with other classes (such as SenseConnector, or   Thing subclasses), to create an "occluded view."  This lets you   exclude certain objects from view, and you can make the exclusion vary   according to the point of view. <p>   This class is useful for situations where the view from one location   to another is partially obstructed.  For example, suppose we have two   rooms, connected by a window between them.  The window is the sense   connector that connects the two top-level locations, and it makes   objects in one room visible from the point of view of the other room.   Suppose that one room contains a bookcase, with its back to the   window.  From the point of view of the other room, we can't see   anything inside the bookcase.  This class allows for such special   situations. <p>   Note that occlusion rules are applied "globally" within a room - that   is, anything that an Occluder occludes will be removed from view, even   if it's visible from another, non-occluding connector.  Hence,   occlusion always takes precedence over "inclusion" - if an object is   occluded just once, then it won't be in view, no matter how many times   it's added back into view by other connectors.  This comes from the   order in which the occlusion rules are considered.  Occlusion rules   are always run last, and they can't distinguish the connector that   added an object to view.  So, we first run around and collect up   everything that can be seen, by considering all of the different paths   to seeing those things.  Then, we go through all of the occlusion   rules that apply to the room, and we remove from view everything that   the occluding connectors want to occlude.

'objs' is a LookupTable containing all of the objects   involved in the sense path calculation (the objects are the keys   in the table).  Each object in the table now has its tmpXxx_   properties set to the sense path data we've calculated for that   object - tmpTrans_ is the transparency to the object, tmpAmbient_   is the ambient light level at the object, and so on. <p>   Since our job is to occlude certain objects from view, we'll run   through the table and test each object using our occlusion rule.   If we find that we do occlude an object, we'll set its   transparency to 'opaque' to indicate that it cannot be seen. <p>
