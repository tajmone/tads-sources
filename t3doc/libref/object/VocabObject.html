If   this property is set to nil for an object, that object can never   be used as a possessive.

When we interactively prompt for   help resolving an ambiguous noun phrase, we'll put the list of   ambiguous matches in ascending order of this property value. <p>   In most cases, the prompt order doesn't matter, so most objects   won't have to override the default setting.  Sometimes, though, a   set of objects will be identified in the game as "first",   "second", "third", etc., and in these cases it's desirable to have   the objects presented in the same order as the names indicate: <p>   Which door do you mean, the first door, the second door, or the   third door? <p>   By default, we use the same value as our pluralOrder, since the   plural order has essentially the same purpose. <p>

When a command contains a plural noun   phrase, we'll sort the items that match the plural phrase in   ascending order of this property value. <p>   In most cases, the plural resolution order doesn't matter.  Once   in a while, though, a set of objects will be named as "first,"   "second," "third," and so on; in these cases, it's nice to have   the order of resolution match the nominal ordering. <p>   Note that the sorting order only applies within the matches for a   particular plural phrase, not globally throughout the entire list   of objects in a command.  For example, if the player types TAKE   BOXES AND BOOKS, we'll sort the boxes in one group, and then we'll   sort the books as a separate group - but all of the boxes will   come before any of the books, regardless of the plural orders. <p>   &gt;take books and boxes <br> first book: Taken. <br> second book: Taken. <br> third book: Taken. <br> left box: Taken. <br> middle box: Taken. <br> right box: Taken. <p>

During disambiguation, if the   parser finds two objects with equivalent logicalness (as   determined by the 'verify' process for the particular Action being   performed), it will pick the one with the higher intrinsic   likelihood value.

This can be useful when nouns and plurals are all inherited from   base classes, and only adjectives are to be specified.  (In fact,   any word that consists of a single hyphen will be ignored, but   this is generally only useful for the adjective-only case.) <p>   During preinitialization, we'll parse this string and generate   dictionary entries and individual vocabulary properties for the   parts of speech we find. <p>   Note that the format described above is specific to the English   version of the library.  Non-English versions will probably want   to use different formats to conveniently encode appropriate   language-specific information in the initializer string.  See the   comments for initializeVocabWith() for more details. <p>   You can use the special wildcard # to match any numeric   adjective.  This only works as a wildcard when it stands alone,   so a string like "7#" is matched as that literal string, not as a   wildcard.  If you want to use a pound sign as a literal   adjective, just put it in double quotes. <p>   You can use the special wildcard "\u0001" (include the double   quotes within the string) to match any literal adjective.  This   is the literal adjective equivalent of the pound sign.  We use   this funny character value because it is unlikely ever to be   interesting in user input. <p>   If you want to match any string for a noun and/or adjective, you   can't do it with this property.  Instead, just add the property   value noun='*' to the object. <p>

This is a token that is acceptable in   our vocabulary, but which we can only use in combination with one   or more "strong" tokens.  (A token is strong if it's not weak, so   we need only keep track of one or the other kind.  Weak tokens   are much less common than strong tokens, so it takes a lot less   space if we store the weak ones instead of the strong ones.) <p>   The purpose of weak tokens is to allow players to use more words   to refer to some objects without creating ambiguity.  For   example, if we have a house, and a front door of the house, we   might want to allow the player to call the front door "front door   of house."  If we just defined the door's vocabulary thus,   though, we'd create ambiguity if the player tried to refer to   "house," even though this obviously doesn't create any ambiguity   to a human reader.  Weak tokens fix the problem: we define   "house" as a weak token for the front door, which allows the   player to refer to the front door as "front door of house", but   prevents the front door from matching just "house". <p>   By default, this is nil to indicate that we don't have any weak   tokens to check.  If the object has weak tokens, this should be   set to a list of strings giving the weak tokens. <p>

This is essentially complementary to   filterResolveList: the function is to "unfilter" a pronoun binding   that contains this object so that it restores any objects that   would have been filtered out by filterResolveList from the   original noun phrase binding. <p>   This routine is called whenever the parser is called upon to   resolve a pronoun ("TAKE THEM").  This routine is called for each   object in the "raw" pronoun binding, which is simply the list of   objects that was stored by the previous command as the antecedent   for the pronoun.  After this routine has been called for each   object in the raw pronoun binding, the final list will be passed   through filterResolveList(). <p>   'lst' is the raw pronoun binding so far, which might reflect   changes made by this method called on previous objects in the   list.  'typ' is the pronoun type (PronounIt, PronounThem, etc)   describing the pronoun phrase being resolved.  The return value is   the new pronoun binding list; if this routine doesn't need to make   any changes, it should simply return 'lst'. <p>   In some cases, filterResolveList chooses which of two or more   possible ways to bind a noun phrase, with the binding dependent   upon other conditions, such as the current action.  In these   cases, it's often desirable for a subsequent pronoun reference to   make the same decision again, choosing from the full set of   possible bindings.  This routine facilitates that by letting the   object put back objects that were filtered out, so that the   filtering can once again run on the full set of possible bindings   for the pronoun reference. <p>   This base implementation just returns the original list unchanged.   See CollectiveGroup for an override that uses this. <p>

This method allows the object to act globally on the entire   list, so that the filtering can be sensitive to the presence or   absence in the list of other objects, and can affect the presence   of other objects. <p>   'lst' is a list of ResolveInfo objects describing the tentative   resolution of the noun phrase.  'action' is the Action object   representing the command.  'whichObj' is the object role   identifier of the object being resolved (DirectObject,   IndirectObject, etc).  'np' is the noun phrase production that   we're resolving; this is usually a subclass of NounPhraseProd.   'requiredNum' is the number of objects required, when an exact   quantity is specified; this is nil in cases where the quantity is   unspecified, as in 'all' or an unquantified plural ("take coins"). <p>   The result is a new list of ResolveInfo objects, which need not   contain any of the objects of the original list, and can add new   objects not in the original list, as desired. <p>   By default, we simply return the original list. <p>

For example, it's often   convenient to represent a door using two game objects - one for   each side - but the two really represent the same door from the   player's perspective. <p>   The parser uses an object's facets to resolve a pronoun when the   original antecedent goes out of scope.  In our door example, if   we refer to the door, then walk through it to the other side,   then refer to 'it', the parser will realize from the facet   relationship that 'it' now refers to the other side of the door. <p>

This is the owner that we report for this   object if we're asked to distinguish this object from another   object in a disambiguation prompt.  The nominal owner isn't   necessarily the only owner.  Note that if getNominalOwner()   returns a non-nil value, isOwnedBy(getNominalOwner()) should   always return true. <p>   By default, we'll simply return our 'owner' property. <p>

'target' is the object to   which we add our vocabulary words, and 'done' is a vector of   classes that have been visited so far. <p>   Since a class can be inherited more than once in an inheritance   tree (for example, a class can have multiple superclasses, each   of which have a common base class), we keep a vector of all of   the classes we've visited.  If we're already in the vector, we'll   skip adding vocabulary for this class or its superclasses, since   we must have already traversed this branch of the tree from   another subclass. <p>

This parses the   given vocabulary initializer string and adds the words defined in   the string to the dictionary. <p>   Note that this parsing is intentionally located in the   English-specific part of the library, because it is expected that   other languages will want to define their own vocabulary   initialization string formats.  For example, a language with   gendered nouns might want to use gendered articles in the   initializer string as an author-friendly way of defining noun   gender; languages with inflected (declined) nouns and/or   adjectives might want to encode inflected forms in the   initializer.  Non-English language implementations are free to   completely redefine the format - there's no need to follow the   conventions of the English format in other languages where   different formats would be more convenient. <p>

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>isOwnedBy (obj)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/thing.t.html">thing.t</a>[<a href="../source/thing.t.html#962">962</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Ownership: a vocab-object can be marked as owned by a given Thing.   This allows command input to refer to the owned object using   possessive syntax (such as, in English, "x's y"). <p>   This method returns true if 'self' is owned by 'obj'.  The parser   generally tests for ownership in this direction, as opposed to   asking for obj's owner, because a given object might have multiple   owners, and might not be able to enumerate them all (or, at least,   might not be able to enumerate them efficiently).  It's usually   efficient to determine whether a given object qualifies as an   owner, and from the parser's persepctive that's the question   anyway, since it wants to determine if the "x" in "x's y"   qualifies as my owner. <p>   By default, we simply return true if 'obj' matches our 'owner'   property (and is not nil). <p>

The parser calls this routine to test this object   for a match to a noun phrase when all of the following conditions   are true: <p>   - this object is in scope; <p>   - our vocabulary matches the noun phrase, which means that ALL of   the words in the player's noun phrase are associated with this   object with the corresponding parts of speech.  Note the special   wildcard vocabulary words: '#' as an adjective matches any number   used as an adjective; '*' as a noun matches any word used as any   part of speech. <p>   'origTokens' is the list of the original input words making up   the noun phrase, in canonical tokenizer format.  Each element of   this list is a sublist representing one token. <p>   'adjustedTokens' is the "adjusted" token list, which provides   more information on how the parser is analyzing the phrase but   may not contain the exact original tokens of the command.  In the   adjusted list, the tokens are represented by pairs of values in   the list: the first value of each pair is a string giving the   adjusted token text, and the second value of the pair is a   property ID giving the part of speech of the parser's   interpretation of the phrase.  For example, if the noun phrase is   "red book", the list might look like ['red', &amp;adjective, 'book',   &amp;noun]. <p>   The adjusted token list in some cases contains different tokens   than the original input.  For example, when the command contains   a spelled-out number, the parser will translate the spelled-out   number to a numeral format and provide the numeral string in the   adjusted token list: 'a hundred and thirty-four' will become   '134' in the adjusted token list. <p>   If this object does not match the noun phrase, this routine   returns nil.  If the object is a match, the routine returns   'self'.  The routine can also return a different object, or even   a list of objects - in this case, the parser will consider the   noun phrase to have matched the returned object or objects rather   than this original match. <p>   Note that it isn't necessary to check that the input tokens match   our defined vocabulary words, because the parser will already   have done that for us.  This routine is only called after the   parser has already determined that all of the noun phrase's words   match ours. <p>   By default, we do two things.  First, we check to see if ALL of   our tokens are "weak" tokens, and if they are, we indicate that   we do NOT match the phrase.  Second, if we pass the "weak token"   test, we'll invoke the common handling in matchNameCommon(), and   return the result. <p>   In most cases, games will want to override matchNameCommon()   instead of this routine.  matchNameCommon() is the common handler   for both normal and disambiguation-reply matching, so overriding   that one routine will take care of both kinds of matching.  Games   will only need to override matchName() separately in cases where   they need to differentiate normal matching and disambiguation   matching. <p>

By default, we'll check with our   state object if we have a state object; if not, we'll simply   return 'self' to indicate that we do indeed match the given   tokens. <p>   In most cases, when a game wishes to customize name matching for   an object, it can simply override this routine.  This routine   provides common handling for matchName() and matchNameDisambig(),   so overriding this routine will take care of both the normal and   disambiguation matching cases.  In cases where a game needs to   customize only normal matching or only disambiguation matching,   it can override one of those other routines instead. <p>

<a name="matchNameDisambig"></a>

This is similar to   matchName(), but is called for each object in an ambiguous object   list for which a disambiguation response was provided.  As with   matchName(), we only call this routine for objects that match the   dictionary vocabulary. <p>   This routine is separate from matchName() because a   disambiguation response usually only contains a partial name.   For example, the exchange might go something like this: <p>   &gt;take box <br> Which box do you mean, the cardboard box, or the wood box?   &gt;cardboard <p>   Note that it is not safe to assume that the disambiguation   response can be prepended to the original noun phrase to make a   complete noun phrase; if this were safe, we'd simply concatenate   the two strings and call matchName().  This would work for the   example above, since we'd get "cardboard box" as the new noun   phrase, but it wouldn't work in general.  Consider these examples: <p>   &gt;open post office box <br> Which post office box do you mean, box 100, box 101, or box 102? <p>   &gt;take jewel <br> Which jewel do you mean, the emerald, or the diamond? <p>   There's no general way of assembling the disambiguation response   and the original noun phrase together into a new noun phrase, so   rather than trying to use matchName() for both purposes, we   simply use a separate routine to match the disambiguation name. <p>   Note that, when this routine is called, this object will have   been previously matched with matchName(), so there is no question   that this object matches the original noun phrase.  The only   question is whether or not this object matches the response to   the "which one do you mean" question. <p>   The return value has the same meaning as for matchName(). <p>   By default, we simply invoke the common handler.  Note that games   will usually want to override matchNameCommon() instead of this   routine, since matchNameCommon() provides common handling for the   main match and disambiguation match cases.  Games should only   override this routine when they need to do something different   for normal vs disambiguation matching. <p>
