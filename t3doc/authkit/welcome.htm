<h1>Welcome to the TADS 3 Author's Kit</h1>

Thanks for installing the TADS 3 Author's Kit!  This kit has
everything you need to create your own Interactive Fiction games
using TADS 3.

<p>For news and information about TADS, please visit the official
TADS web site, <a href='http://www.tads.org'>www.tads.org</a>.

<hr>


<h2>TADS Player Kit</h2>

<p>Now that you've installed the Author's Kit, you might also want
to install the TADS Player Kit.  The Player Kit is a combined
version of the Interpreter that can play games for both TADS 2
and TADS 3, and also features the Game Chest for organizing your
favorite games.  You can find the Player Kit download
on <a href="http://www.tads.org">tads.org</a>.



<h2>Problems?</h2>

<p>If you run into any problems with TADS, please check the <a
href='../compat.htm'>System Compatibility Notes</a>.  There are a few
known problems with certain Windows configurations, and the notes
explain how to fix these.  You should read the compatibility
notes in particular if:

<ul>
  <li>HTML TADS is crashing;
  <li>you're using a Linux system running Wine;
  <li>you're using a non-English version of Windows.
</ul>



<h2><a name='getting_started'>Documentation</a></h2>

<p>The TADS 3 documentation is organized into several manuals, which
you can find them on the <a href="../../doc/index.htm">User's Manuals</a>
page.

<p>If you're new to TADS, there are two introductory books by Eric Eve
to choose from.  <i>Getting Started in TADS 3</i> is a tutorial
designed for beginners, especially those without prior programming
experience.  <i>Learning TADS 3</i> is written for confident newcomers
and those with a little programming experience.  They're both
available on the <a href="../../doc/index.htm">User's Manuals</a> page.

<p>You can find help with programming and game design questions on
a number of Interactive Fiction community forums.  For links to
IF community resources, see <a href="http://www.tads.org">tads.org</a>.
