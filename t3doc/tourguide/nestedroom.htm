<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">You're not likely to use the NestedRoom class directly in your code, but since we shall be looking at many of its subclasses, it's worth starting with this base class.
<br>

<br>
According to the comments in the library code:
<br>

<br>
<i>A Nested Room is any object that isn't a room but which can contain an actor: chairs, beds, platforms, vehicles, and the like.
<br>

<br>
An important property of nested rooms is that they're not fully-fledged rooms for the purposes of actor arrivals and departures. Specifically, an actor moving from a room to a nested room within the room does not trigger an actor.travelTo invocation, but simply moves the actor from the containing room to the nested room. Moving from the nested room to the containing room likewise triggers no actor.travelTo invocation. The travelTo method is not applicable for intra-room travel because no TravelConnector objects are traversed in such travel; we simply move in and out of contained objects. To mitigate this loss of notification, we instead call actor.travelWithin() when moving among nested locations.
<br>

<br>
By default, an actor attempting to travel from a nested location via a directional command will simply attempt the travel as though the actor were in the enclosing location.</i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">
<br>
The point to note here is that a NestedRoom is not a fully-fledged Room; it is not a TravelConnector, is not usually entered or left via TravelConnector, and does not normally employ the TravelVia method to enter or leave it (or at least, not when simply leaving the NestedRoom for its enclosing room, as in getting off a bed or chair).
<br>

<br>
To receive notification of entering or leaving a NestedRoom, you can't use enteringRoom(), leavingRoom, travelerArriving(), and travelerLeaving, but you can use <b>actorTravelingWithin(origin, dest) </b>(defined on BasicLocation, and hence available to Room as well as NestedRoom). As the comment in the library code describes it, the purpose of this method is to:
<br>

<br>
<i>Receive notification of travel among nested rooms. When an actor moves between two locations related directly by containing (such as from a chair to the room containing the chair, or vice versa), we first call this routine on the origin of the travel, then we move the actor, then we call this same routine on the destination of the travel.
<br>

<br>
This routine is used any time an actor is moved with travelWithin(). This is not used when an actor travels between locations related by a TravelConnector object rather than by direct containment.
<br>

<br>
We do nothing by default. Locations can override this if they wish to perform any special handling during this type of travel. </i></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

Some important, or at least potentially useful, properties of NestedRoom (inherited by and hence common to its subclasses) include:

By default, this will simply be the nested room's location.

By default, this is simply the nested room's name.
&nbsp;<br>
</font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="top"><td width="14"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b></b><font face="Symbol" size="2" color="#000000">&#183;</font><b></b></font></td><td><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>stagingLocations</b> - The valid "staging locations" for this nested room. This is a list of the rooms from which an actor can DIRECTLY reach this nested room; in other words, the actor will be allowed to enter 'self', with no intervening travel, if the actor is directly in any of these locations. If the list is empty, there are no valid staging locations. The point of listing staging locations is to make certain that the actor has to go through one of these locations in order to get into this nested room. This ensures that we enforce any conditions or trigger any side effects of moving through the staging locations, so that a player can't bypass a puzzle by trying to move directly from one location to another without going through the required intermediate steps. Since we always require that an actor go through one of our staging locations in order to enter this nested room, and since we carry out the travel to the staging location using implied commands (which are just ordinary commands, entered and executed automatically by the parser), we can avoid having to code any checks redundantly in both the staging locations and any other nearby locations. By default, an actor can only enter a nested room from the room's direct container. For example, if a chair is on a stage, an actor must be standing on the stage before the actor can sit on the chair.
