<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><i>Nothing is hidden except in order to be revealed, nor does anything become concealed but that it might come into the open</i>. - Mark 4.22
<br>

<br>
Mark was writing about Jesus' parables, not Interactive Fiction, although since according to at least some commentators Mark treats Jesus' parables as riddles and according to Nick Montfort (<i>Twisty Little Passages</i>. Cambridge, MA &amp; London: MIT Press, 2003) the riddle is one of the precursors of IF, there may be a tenuous link here. It may be that Mark portrays Jesus' parables as employing concealment as a strategy of revelation; it is certainly the case that IF authors often hide objects in their games with the intention that the player will find them (hopefully with more success than the disciples in Mark).
<br>

<br>
There are various ways objects can be hidden and made to appear in response to a player action. We'll first explore how this can be done using Classes and concepts we've already met, and show how the library classes <a href="hidden.htm">Hidden</a> and <a href="presentlater.htm">PresentLater</a> can help with the task.
