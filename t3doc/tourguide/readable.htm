<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A Readable, as its name suggest, is an object that can be read. In fact you can READ a Thing - it has precisely the same effect as using EXAMINE on it. The main difference between a Thing and a Readable is that on a Readable you can program different responses to READ and EXAMINE. EXAMINE Readable results in the display of its desc property; but READ Readable results in the display of its readDesc (assuming readDesc is defined, i.e. non-nil, otherwise the desc property is displayed).
<br>

<br>
The other main difference between a Readable and a Thing is that a Readable is regarded as the more logical target of a READ command, so that other things being equal, the parser will choose a Readable object over other kinds of Thing when disambiguating the direct object of READ (i.e. deciding which object the player meant when the command is ambiguous).
<br>

<br>
Since the tablets all contain squares of letters, they could reasonably be regarded as Readable. We could therefore redefine the Tablet class as:
<br>

<br>
<font face="Courier New" size="2" color="#000000">class&nbsp;Tablet&nbsp;:&nbsp;<b>Readable</b>&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;desc&nbsp;=&nbsp;"\^&lt;&lt;theName&gt;&gt;&nbsp;is&nbsp;about&nbsp;eight&nbsp;inches&nbsp;square&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;inch&nbsp;thick.&nbsp;<b>&lt;&lt;readDesc&gt;&gt;"</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>readDesc&nbsp;=&nbsp;"On&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;inscribed:\b&lt;FONT&nbsp;FACE='TADS-Typewriter'&gt;&lt;&lt;inscription&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\b"</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
