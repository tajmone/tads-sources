# TADS 2 Unix Sources

The TADS 2 Unix source distribution was separated from the generic sources distribution.
Although the original [README] file mentions that the TADS 2 Unix sources can be downloaded from TADS website, they currently seem to be available only from the [IF Archive]:

- https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/programming/tads2/source/

At the above link you can find the Unix sources in the `tads23-unix.tar.gz` file, or you can use the following direct download link:

- [`tads23-unix.tar.gz`][tads23-unix.tar.gz]

That file contains the latest sources of the Unix port of TADS:

- TADS 2 version 2.5.9
- TADS 3 version 3.0.8

Please see www.tads.org if you need to contact anyone for more help.
