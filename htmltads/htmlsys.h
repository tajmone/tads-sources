Name
  htmlsys.h - HTML system API interface
Function
  These classes define a set of system-dependent functions that the
  HTML formatter needs to do its work.  These classes must be implemented
  separately for each operating and/or window system.  The purpose
  of these classes is to provide a portable interface to these system-
  dependent functions, so that the HTML formatter doesn't need to be
  modified for each new operating system that it's ported to.  These
  classes isolate the system-dependent code so that it can be easily
  found for porting purposes.

  Note that these classes are designed as abstract interfaces.  The
  reason for this design is to allow these classes to be easily used
  with an existing C++ application framework.  To use the classes from
  an application framework to implement the window object interface
  (CHtmlSysWin), for example, simply create a subclass of the
  appropriate window class from your framework, and make your subclass
  multiply inherit from CHtmlSysWin as well as from the framework
  class.  Because CHtmlSysWin is an abstract interface class, it
  should always be easy to use it in a multiple inheritance design
  without worrying about any of the problematic aspects of multiple
  inheritance (such as virtual base classes).

 *   Font description.  This is used to specify the characteristics of a
 *   desired font to a window, so that the window can create an
 *   appropriate system font appropriate for the description.
 *
 *   The oshtml_charset_id_t type is a system-defined type that specifies
 *   the character set to be used for the font.  On systems such as
 *   Windows where fonts are mapped to particular code pages, we use this
 *   to select a font that contains the code page mapping that we need for
 *   each text string.
 *
 *   Note that this is a portable concrete class - there is no need to
 *   subclass this class per platform.  This class is defined to provide a
 *   portable means of describing a font, so that an appropriate system
 *   font object can be created based on a description generated by
 *   portable code.

 *   by the system window code.  Refer to CHtmlSysWin::get_font().
 *
 *   A note on memory management: The portable code never deletes font
 *   objects.  Instead, the system code is expected to keep a list of all of
 *   the font objects ever created.  Each time a caller asks to create a new
 *   font via CHtmlSysWin::get_font(), the system code first scans the list
 *   to see if the same font (with the identical descriptor) has been
 *   allocated already; if so, it simply returns the existing CHtmlSysFont
 *   instance.  If not, it creates a new CHtmlSysFont instance, adds it to
 *   the list, and returns the new instance.
 *
 *   So, even though the portable code never deletes font objects, it won't
 *   leak memory as long as the system code uses this cache list approach.
 *   Font memory will never shrink, but it will only grow up to a fixed upper
 *   limit - specifically, the maximum font memory will be the amount needed
 *   to hold one instance of each distinct font used in the game.
 *
 *   The reasoning behind this approach is that (a) a given game has a
 *   relatively small number of distinct fonts it uses, (b) each font tends
 *   to be used over and over many times, and (c) on many systems it's a
 *   relatively heavy operation to create a system font resource.  So it's
 *   more efficient to use this cache approach than to create and destroy
 *   font objects on each use.  Fonts objects would also be fairly complex to
 *   account for, so this scheme avoids the need for reference counting or
 *   other means to avoid font memory leaks.

     *   with the mouse, say.  In this case, the portable code would call

     *   to figure out where to position the part we *are* redrawing - "CDE".

     *   original position (0,0) to figure out where to draw "CDE".  So, it's
     *   important that the width returned from measure_text("AB") properly
     *   reflects the character positioning distance.  On most modern systems
     *   with proportional typefaces, the positioning width of a character
     *   often differs from its rendering width, because a glyph can overhang
     *   its positioning area and overlap the previous and next glyph areas.
     *   System APIs usually therefore offer separate measurement functions
     *   for the bounding box (the overall area occupied by all pixels in a
     *   string) and the positioning box (the area used to calculate where
     *   adjacent glyphs should be drawn).
     *
     *   Note that the heights returned - both the returned y value giving
     *   the overall box height, as well as the ascent height - must be the
     *   DESIGN HEIGHTS for the font, NOT the actual height of the specific
     *   set of characters in 'str'.  The returned height is thus the
     *   *maximum* of the individual heights of *all* of the characters in
     *   the font.  This DOESN'T mean that a port has to actually run through
     *   all of the possible characters in a font and measure each one to

     *   that don't have tails (tails: g, j, p, q, y - the bits that drop
     *   below the baseline).  The reason the ascent height is important is
     *   that it tells us where the baseline is relative to the overall
     *   rectangle containing a character in the font, and the baseline is
     *   important because it's the reference point for aligning adjacent
     *   text from different fonts.)

     *   OS_BANNER_STYLE_MOREMODE set, the port should implement MORE mode
     *   according to local conventions.  One possible implementation is to
     *   do nothing special: since we presumably are showing the text in a
     *   standard GUI window with a scrollbar, any text that spills beyond
     *   the vertical extent of the window will simply be scrolled off the
     *   bottom, and we can leave it up to the user to manually use the
     *   scrollbar to see the text below the bottom of the window.
     *
     *   In most cases, though, it's best to simulate the behavior of the
     *   Unix "more" program, since (a) this is much more convenient for
     *   users, and (b) it's what most users are accustomed to in a
     *   terminal-style interface like ours.  Here's roughly how this works.
     *   Whenever fmt_adjust_vscroll() notifies the window that the document
     *   has grown vertically beyond the current vertical extent of the
     *   window, the window sets an internal flag saying "more mode is
     *   pending."  Whenever the program makes an input call (get_input(),
     *   get_input_timeout(), etc), the window checks the "more mode pending"
     *   flag, and if set, clears that flag and sets another one saying "more
     *   mode is active."  In the input routines, as long as the "more mode"
     *   flag is set, we treat keyboard input specially: the SPACE key
     *   scrolls down by a page, the RETURN key scrolls down by a "line"
     *   (which is an essentially arbitrary unit, since we can have a mixture
     *   of text heights in the window - the design height of the default or
     *   current font is usually a good choice), the up/down arrow keys
     *   scroll by a line one way or the other; assign other keys according
     *   to local conventions or your preferences, but generally ignore keys
     *   to which you haven't assigned a special more-mode meaning.  When in
     *   more mode, if at any time the vertical scroll position becomes such
     *   that the bottom of the document is in view, cancel more mode and
     *   switch to ordinary input mode.  In ordinary input mode, you'd
     *   normally use a different scrolling behavior: if the input caret
     *   isn't visible, and the user presses any key that affects the input,
     *   immediately jump directly to a scrolling position that brings the
     *   caret into view.  This allows the user to scroll up to look at old
     *   text in the transcript, but then immediately jump back to the
     *   command line just by starting to type some input.
     *
     *   We leave all of this up to the port code, though, because we want to
     *   give each port maximum flexibility in applying local customs.  Some
     *   ports might not even want a MORE mode at all, and some might use
     *   different key mappings or different overall behaviors.  Some ports
     *   might provide a visual indication that MORE mode is active
     *   (something like the "[More]" prompt that the Unix "more" command and
     *   the TADS text-only interpreters display), while some might be
     *   content to rely on the scrollbars as a sufficient visual cue.  The
     *   Windows interpreter uses something like the traditional "[More]"
     *   prompt, but it has a couple of user-configurable options for how to
     *   display it: it can be shown in the status bar along the bottom of

     *   document area of the window itself, superimposed over the document's

     *   settings made programmatically, such as through the <BODY> tag.
     *
     *   The "background" color is the color used to fill the background of
     *   the window, where no text or graphics are explicitly drawn.
     *
     *   The "text" color is the default color for ordinary text (i.e., text
     *   that isn't hyperlinked or given an explicit font color via <FONT
     *   COLOR=xxx> or the like).
     *
     *   The "input" color is the color to use for input text.
     *
     *   The "link" color is the color for hyperlinked text - that is, text
     *   inside an <A HREF> tag.
     *
     *   The "vlink" color is the "visited" hyperlink text color.  We include
     *   this for completeness, but currently we don't use it, since we don't
     *   really have a sense of visited vs unvisited links in the same way
     *   that a browser would.
     *
     *   The "alink" color is the color for "active" hyperlink text.  This is
     *   the color for hyperlink text when the link is being clicked by the
     *   mouse; that is, when the user has moved the mouse over the hyperlink
     *   and then clicked and held down the button.  This is the color to use
     *   as long as the button is being held down.
     *
     *   The "hlink" color is the "hover" hyperlink text color.  This is the
     *   color for when the mouse is hovering over the hyperlink, but the
     *   mouse button isn't being held down.
     *
     *   Note that the system implementation is free to ignore all of these
     *   color settings, or to use them only if user preferences allow, or
     *   under any other conditions suitable for the local system.  On most
     *   systems, there are four possible color sources for any given text
     *   fragment: user preferences; set_html_xxx_color() settings; explicit
     *   <FONT> and other settings; and OS defaults.  The interpreter then
     *   implements a hierarchy to determine which of these to use.  The
     *   exact hierarchy is up to the interpreter, but it's usually like
     *   this:
     *
     *   - If the user preferences allow the user to select an "override"
     *   option, and the user selects this option, use the user preference
     *   color setting applicable to a given text fragment.  (The user
     *   preferences might allow the user to select each of these color types
     *   individually - text, background, input, alink, vlink, etc - in which
     *   case the interpreter should pick the right one for the context.  If
     *   the preferences don't distinguish color by context, just use the
     *   single color setting.)
     *
     *   - If "override" isn't selected (or isn't offered), and there's a
     *   <FONT COLOR=xxx> setting for a given text fragment, use that.
     *
     *   - Otherwise, if there's been a call to set_html_xxx_color() for the
     *   given context with use_default=FALSE, use that color.
     *
     *   - If there's been no call to set_html_xxx_color() for the given
     *   context, or there's been a call with use_default=TRUE, AND there's a
     *   user preference setting applicable to the context, use the user
     *   preference setting.

     *   to be invoked) with the given context.  The 'repeat_count' parameter
     *   to the callback indicates how many times the sound has been played.
     *
     *   'repeat' is the number of times to play back the sound; 0 indicates
     *   that the sound should be played forever (or until cancel_sound is
     *   called, whichever comes first).  The player can ignore the repeat
     *   count, however (this is to simplify the implementation when it's not
     *   convenient or useful to implement repetition in the player itself).
     *   If the repeat count is obeyed, the callback will be invoked after
     *   all iterations have been performed, and will indicate the number of
     *   iterations completed.  If the repeat count is ignored, the callback
     *   will be invoked after the single iteration we'll perform and will
     *   indicate that only one iteration has been played.  In this case,
     *   caller can simply requeue the sound (if still desired) with the next
     *   lower repeat count.
     *
     *   'vol' is the base playback volume for the track, in the range
     *   0..100, where 0 is silence and 100 is unattenuated (i.e., play the
     *   track at the full volume level of the recorded data).  Values
     *   outside this range are invalid and should be pegged to the range
     *   (i.e., treat anything below 0 as 0, and anything over 100 as 100).
     *   This volume level is NOT a master volume for the whole computer or
     *   whole application - it shouldn't affect any other sound levels in
     *   the system or be used to adjust the physical speaker volume.  This
     *   parameter instead simply sets the relative playback volume of this
     *   track.  A volume level of 0 means the track should effectively be
     *   muted; 100 means it should be played back unattenuated, at the full
     *   native volume recorded in the sound file.  Values between 0 and 100
     *   should be perceptually linear volume levels, akin to adjusting a
     *   speaker volume knob between minimum and maximum volume.  If the
     *   local system can't implement per-track relative volume control,
     *   simply ignore this parameter and play back the track at its native
     *   volume level.  (Although you might still want to treat volume 0 as
     *   mute in this case, if possible.)
     *
     *   'fade_in' and 'fade_out' are the start-of-track and end-of-track
     *   fade times, in milliseconds.  Zero means that the track should
     *   start/end at full volume.  If a non-zero fade time is given, it
     *   means that the volume on the track should fade in or out over the
     *   given interval - fade_in is the interval for fading in at the start
     *   of the track, and fade_out is the interval for fading out at the end
     *   of the track.  This is a "best effort" feature - if fades can't be
     *   implemented on the platform, or can't be implemented for certain
     *   audio formats, simply ignore the fade parameters and start/stop at
     *   full volume.
     *
     *   'crossfade' indicates whether the end-of-track fade-out should be a
     *   cross-fade or a regular fade.  True means cross-fade: as soon as the
     *   fade-out begins, call the 'done' callback, which will tell the queue
     *   manager that it can start playing the next track in the queue
     *   immediately, even while the fade is proceeding.  False means a
     *   regular fade-out: the 'done' callback should be invoked after the
     *   track is fully finished (including the fade), as normal.  If
     *   cross-fades can't be implemented on the platform, ignore this
     *   parameter and do a normal fade-out.
     *
     *   Note that 'crossfade' doesn't affect the fade-in.  Any cross-fade at
     *   fade-in is controlled by the *outgoing* track - it's up to the
     *   previous track to determine when to call the 'done' callback to
     *   enable to next queued track to begin playing.
     *
     *   When the repeat count is 0 or >1, the fade-in should be applied only
     *   to the first iteration, and the fade-out should be applied only to
     *   the last iteration.  There should be no fade between repeated
     *   iterations of the same track.
     *
     *   Returns zero on success, non-zero on error.  If a non-zero value is
     *   returned, the callback is NOT invoked.
     *
     *   The URL is provided for diagnostic purposes.  If the routine
     *   encounters an error and wants to provide details, it can use the URL
     *   in a debugging message to indicate the object that caused the error.

     *
     *   'ms' is the duration of the fade, in milliseconds.  The fade should
     *   begin 'ms' milliseconds before the end of the track; the volume
     *   level should be gradually decreased over that interval from the
     *   normal playback volume to silence.
     *
     *   The point of this routine is to allow an *incoming* track to ask for
     *   a crossfade as it starts.  The request can't be made as part of the
     *   play_sound() on the incoming track - not just because play_sound()
     *   doesn't offer a way to do this, but because there's no way for
     *   play_sound() to offer a way to do this even if it wanted to.  A
     *   cross-fade is always a feature of an outgoing track, because the way
     *   you accomplish a cross-fade is to have the outgoing track signal
     *   that it's finished (by calling the 'done' callback) at the start of
     *   its fade-out, to let the next queued track begin playing.  So, the
     *   way to handle an incoming cross-fade is to queue the incoming sound,
     *   and call this routine on the immediately preceding sound in the
     *   queue.
     *
     *   Note that there might already be a scheduled fade-out on this track,
     *   because play_sound() can request a cross-fade as well (and because
     *   this routine could conceivably be called more than once for a single
     *   track).  If there are multiple fade-outs for the same track, the
     *   recommended handling is to combine them by always setting the volume
     *   level to the MININUM of the volume levels from the competing fades.
     *   This will ensure a monotonic fade - the volume level won't jump
     *   around, because it will only be able to decrease over time.  The
     *   volume level might not decrease in a simple straight line (it could
     *   be a series of linear segments, because the different fade slopes
     *   might intersect), but this really shouldn't matter perceptually;
     *   most listeners probably won't even notice that the fade isn't
     *   perfectly linear as long as it's monotonic.
     *
     *   If cross-fades can't be implemented on this platform, or it's not
     *   possible to add a cross-fade to a track already being played, simply
     *   ignore calls to this routine.

     *   Cancel the sound.
     *
     *   If 'sync' is true, the sound must be canceled, and the callback
     *   invoked, BEFORE this routine returns.  If 'sync' is false, this
     *   routine MAY return before the sound has actually stopped, as long as
     *   the sound is scheduled for cancellation very shortly.  (Of course,
     *   the callback should still be invoked in this case, as soon as the
     *   sound actually stops playing.)
     *
     *   (The point os 'sync' is to allow for situations where the playback
     *   is handled by a background thread, hardware sound card buffers, or
     *   another asynchronous player mechanism.  For example, if the playback
     *   is being handled by a background thread, when 'sync' is false this
     *   routine could simply post a message to the playback thread telling
     *   it to stop, then immediately return without waiting for the message
     *   to be received.  Playback might continue in this case for a few
     *   milliseconds, until the OS gets around to scheduling the playback
     *   thread for its next chance to run.  This type of approach helps keep
     *   the UI responsive by avoiding blocking waits for playback to catch
     *   up with UI activity.)
     *
     *   If 'sync' is true OR 'fade_out_ms' is zero, the cancellation is
     *   abrupt - the sound should simply be cut off in mid-stream.  If a
     *   callback was registered when the sound was started, the callback
     *   should be invoked as though the track had reached its normal ending,
     *   as soon as the playback actually terminates.
     *
     *   If 'fade_out_ms' is non-zero, it specifies a number of milliseconds
     *   over which the sound should gradually fade out.  The fade should
     *   start immediately; the volume of the playback for this sound (and
     *   ONLY this sound) should be reduced gradually from full volume to
     *   silence, over the course of the specified interval.
     *
     *   If a non-zero fade interval is specified, the 'fade_in_bg' flag
     *   specifies how the callback function (if one was specified in
     *   play_sound) should be invoked.  If 'fade_in_bg' is true, it means
     *   that the callback should be invoked immediately, before the function
     *   returns.  Otherwise, the callback should be invoked as soon as the
     *   fade is finished.
     *
     *   Note that regardless of the 'fade_in_bg' setting, the fade itself
     *   should happen "in the background" with respect to the UI, if
     *   possible.  That is, this routine should schedule the fade to begin
     *   immediately, and should then immediately return so that the UI
     *   remains responsive during the fade interval.  This routine should
     *   NOT wait until after the fade is finished to return to its caller.
     *
     *   (The point of setting 'fade_in_bg' to true is to allow for
     *   cross-fade effects: since the callback is invoked immediately, the
     *   next sound in the same queue ("layer") will be able to start playing
     *   immediately, so the new sound will play concurrently while the old
     *   sound fades out.  Using a fade-in with the new sound will
     *   effectively cross-fade the two sounds, creating a smooth transition
     *   between adjacent tracks.)
     *
     *   Synchronous mode and fade mode are mutually exclusive.  If 'sync' is
     *   true, the routine should simply ignore the fade parameters.
     *
     *   Note that the fade setting specified here is independent of the
     *   end-of-track fade specified in play_sound().  The fade specified in
     *   play_sound() only applies when the track plays all the way through
     *   to the end.  The cancel_sound() fade, in contrast, specifies what
     *   should happen immediately at the time of the cancellation, so it
     *   effectively supersedes any play_sound() fade.  In particular, if
     *   'fade_out_ms' in cancel_sound() is zero, the sound should be stopped
     *   abruptly with no fade, EVEN IF play_sound() specified a fade-out.
     *
     *   HANDLING PLATFORM LIMITATIONS:
     *
     *   1. If the local platform can't support concurrent playback of two or
     *   more sounds, this routine should simply ignore fade_in_bg and always
     *   do "foreground" fades - that is, still process the fade in the
     *   background with respect to the UI, but don't invoke the callback
     *   until after the fade is finished.  Waiting to invoke the callback
     *   will ensure that the queue manager doesn't attempt to start playing
     *   another sound until the current sound is terminated.  This approach
     *   will still create a relatively smooth transition effect between
     *   adjacent tracks by doing a fade-out and then a fade-in - not exactly
     *   what the caller asks for when requesting a cross-fade, but a
     *   reasonable facsimile.
     *
     *   2. If it's not possible to perform the fade in the background with
     *   respect to the UI, the recommended fallback is to limit the fade to
     *   a relatively short interval (e.g., one second: so if the caller
     *   requests a 5000ms fade, limit it to 1000ms) and then perform the
     *   fade as a blocking operation.  Keeping the fade time short will
     *   minimize the UI impact of freezing the UI during the fade, while
     *   still smoothing out sound transitions to some degree.
     *
     *   3. If it's not possible to perform fades at all, simply ignore the
     *   fade parameters and stop the sound abruptly.
