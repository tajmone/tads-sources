Name
  htmlinp.h - HTML input editor
Function
  This class handles the internals of editing an input buffer.  This
  class does not provide a user interface; instead, it's intended to
  be used by user interface code to simplify the maintenance of an
  input buffer.

  This class also provides a command history function.
Notes
  The caller provides the buffer, and is responsible for managing
  the memory containing the buffer (in particular, we will not delete
  the buffer).

     *   Set the input buffer's character set (also known as the "code
     *   page").  This MUST be called IF the system implementation of
     *   os_next_char() and os_prev_char() require the character set
     *   information.
     *
     *   In general, the system window code will need to call this for
     *   implementations that (a) support multi-byte character sets (MBCS)
     *   and (b) allow the character set to change on the fly.  On
     *   single-byte-only platforms, os_next_char() and os_prev_char() are
     *   trivial in that one character always equals one byte, so the
     *   character set information isn't needed to implement them.  Even if
     *   MBCSs are supported, the character set information isn't needed if
     *   the character set can't change during execution, since the system
     *   code can simply assume everything's in the fixed app-wide character
     *   set.  It's only necessary to have the per-string information on
     *   systems like Windows, where MBCSs are supported and where each
     *   string can be in its own separate character set.
     *
     *   If the character set information is needed, this must be called
     *   immediately after construction, and again each time the buffer
     *   character set changes (for example, due to a user preference
     *   change).
     *
     *   Note that only one character set can be selected at a time per input
     *   buffer.  It's not possible for an individual input buffer to use a
     *   mix of different character sets - the whole buffer must be in a
     *   single character set.
