 *   Most compilers provide atomic operation intrinsics, and C++-11 actually
 *   made them standard.  If we detect C++-11, we use std::atomic.  If not,
 *   we check for GCC and Clang intrinsic support (both new and legacy.)
 *
 *   Using intrinsics is preferable to using a spinlock, since they translate
 *   to atomic machine instructions (if supported by the machine) and no
 *   locking is happening.
 *
 *   It might look a bit redundant to check for the new intrinsics
 *   (__atomic_*) since they were introduced specifically for C++-11 support;
 *   if they are available, one would think that std::atomic is too.  But
 *   that's usually not the case.  In order to get to std::atomic, the
 *   compiler has to be explicitly told to enable support for C++-11 (through
 *   a command-line switch, usually "-std=c++11".)  In the future, C++-11
 *   will be the default in most compilers.  But as of now, it's not; neither
 *   in GCC nor in Clang.

/*
 *   Watchdog thread.  This is an optional system thread that monitors the
 *   program's activity, and terminates the program if it appears to be
 *   either inactive or looping.  When TADS is running as a network server
 *   that's open to anyone's bytecode programs, we can't count on the
 *   underlying bytecode program being well-behaved.  The watchdog thread
 *   handles some common problem areas:
 *
 *   - If the bytecode program has a bug that gets it stuck in an infinite
 *   loop, it will consume as much CPU time as it's given, which will bring
 *   other processes on the server to a crawl.  The watchdog checks
 *   periodically to see if our process has been consuming a disproportionate
 *   amount of CPU time over a recent interval, and will terminate the
 *   process if so.  This will also shut down programs that are intentionally
 *   (not buggily) doing CPU-intensive computations for long stretches, but
 *   this is a reasonable policy anyway: shared TADS game servers are meant
 *   for interactive games, and if someone wants to run heavy-duty number
 *   crunching, they really shouldn't be using a shared game server for it.
 *
 *   - If the bytecode program has a long period without any network requests
 *   from clients, it probably has a bug in its internal session management
 *   code.  On a public server, a given interpreter session is meant to run
 *   only as long as it's actively being used by a client.  The standard TADS
 *   web server library has an internal watchdog that monitors for client
 *   activity, and shuts itself down after a period of inactivity.  However,
 *   we can't count on every bytecode program using the standard library, and
 *   even those that do could have bugs (in the library itself or in user
 *   code) that prevent the internal inactivity watchdog from working
 *   properly.  So, our system watchdog thread serves as a backup here; if we
 *   don't see any incoming client network requests for an extended period,
 *   we'll assume that the program no longer has any job to do, so we'll shut
 *   it down.  Note that a bytecode program could be intentionally running as
 *   a continuous service, e.g., acting as a web server; but that's really an
 *   abuse of a public TADS server, since a continuously resident process
 *   takes up a lot of memory that's meant to be shared with other users.  So
 *   we don't care whether the bytecode program is running without clients
 *   due to bugs or by design; in either case we want to shut it down.
 *
 *   The system administrator enables the watchdog thread by putting the
 *   variable "watchdog = yes" in the tadsweb.config file.
