/*
 *   The Date intrinsic class stores a date-and-time value representing a
 *   particular point in time, and provides methods and operators for date
 *   arithmetic, formatting, and parsing.
 *
 *   The date/time value is stored internally in terms of universal time
 *   (UTC).  This makes it independent of locations and time zones.  When a
 *   new Date object is created for a given calendar day or clock time, that
 *   source value is assumed to be in terms of the local wall clock time of
 *   the machine it's running on, but a different time zone can be explicitly
 *   specified instead; the Date object automatically translates that local
 *   time value to UTC for storage.  Likewise, when a Date is formatted to a
 *   string representation, or when calendar or clock components are
 *   extracted from it, the formatted or extracted value is translated by
 *   default to the local time zone, but a different time zone can be
 *   specified.
 *
 *   You can create a Date object from a number of other representations for
 *   date values:
 *
 *.   new Date() - creates a Date representing the current date and time.
 *
 *.   new Date('string', refTZ?, refDate?) - parses the string as a date
 *.          value.  'refTZ' is an optional TimeZone object; if provided,
 *.          the date string will be interpreted as a local time in that
 *.          zone, unless the string contains a timezone specifier.  The
 *.          default timezone if 'refTZ' is missing is the local system's
 *.          time zone.  'refDate' is an optional Date object that's used
 *.          to fill in certain missing date elements in the string.  If
 *.          the string doesn't specify the year (e.g., 'March 1'), the
 *.          year is taken from refDate; if the string only specifies only
 *.          a time, the date is taken from refDate.  If the date uses a
 *.          two-digit year number ('5/15/92'), the century is inferred
 *.          from the reference date by finding the year closest to the
 *.          reference year (for example, if it's currently 2012, '92' is
 *.          interpreted as 1992, since that's closer to 2012 than is
 *.          2092).  The date parser accepts numerous common human-readable
 *.          formats and several standard computer formats.  For a full
 *.          list of, see the System Manual.  The parser uses the locale
 *.          settings from setLocaleInfo() to match month names, weekday
 *.          names, etc; the default settings are for US English format.
 *
 *.   new Date(number, 'J') - 'number' can be an integer or a BigNumber.
 *.          This creates a Date object representing the given number of
 *.          days after January 1, 4713 BCE on the Julian calendar, at
 *.          noon UTC.  The fractional part is the fraction of a day
 *.          past noon; for example, a fractional portion of 0.25
 *.          represents 1/4 of a day, or 6 hours, so it represents a
 *.          clock time of 18:00 UTC (6 hours past noon).
 *
 *.   new Date(number, 'U') - 'number' can be an integer or a BigNumber.
 *.          This creates a Date object representing the given number of
 *.          seconds after standard Unix Epoch (1/1/1970 00:00:00 UTC),
 *.          or before the Epoch if the value is negative.  If 'number'
 *.          is a BigNumber, it can specify fractions of a second, which
 *.          the Date object will round to the nearest milliseconds.
 *.          This constructor format is provided because "seconds since
 *.          1/1/1970" is the standard representation of time on Unix-like
 *.          systems, and as a result it's also common in file formats.
 *
 *.   new Date(year, month, day, tz?) - midnight on year/month/day (all
 *.          given as integers), in the given local time zone 'tz' (given
 *.          as a TimeZone object or a string giving a time zone name).
 *.          The default time zone if 'tz' is omitted is the system's
 *.          local time zone.  The year must be given as the full year
 *.          with century, e.g., 2012, not just 12; the latter is valid
 *.          but is taken literally as the first-century year 12.  The
 *.          month is 1-12 for January to December.  The day is simply
 *.          the calendar day of the month (e.g., 5 for January 5).  The
 *.          year can zero or negative.  Note that because year 0 is a
 *.          valid year in Date's calendar system, negative years are off
 *.          by one from the "BC" convention: in the AD/BC convention,
 *.          the year before AD 1 is 1 BC, not AD 0; so on our calendar,
 *.          year 0 corresponds to 1 BC, -1 is 2 BC, etc.
 *
 *.   new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, ms, tz?) - the
 *.          given date and time value, with each element as an integer.
 *.          The value is in terms of the given local time zone 'tz',
 *.          or the system's local time zone if 'tz' is omitted.  'ms'
 *.          is the number of milliseconds (0-999).
 *
 *   Date arithmetic: the following operators perform calendar calculations
 *   on the date value:
 *
 *.   Date + integer   - add days to the date
 *.   Date - integer   - subtract days from date
 *.   Date + BigNumber - add days (which can include fractional days)
 *.   Date - BigNumber - subtract days (which can include fractional days)
 *.   Date - Date      - number of days between dates (with fractional days)
 *
 *   Adding an integer or BigNumber returns a new Date object representing
 *   the result; Date objects are immutable, so the original Date value isn't
 *   changed by the operation.
 *
 *   Subtracting one Date from another yields a BigNumber with the difference
 *   in days between the two dates.  Note that this might have a fractional
 *   part, because the difference might not be whole days; for example,
 *   subtracting 13:00 from 19:00 on the same day yields 0.25, which is 1/4
 *   of a 24-hour day, or 6 hours..  Like all Date arithmetic, subtraction
 *   works in universal time, so the subtraction yields the true time
 *   difference between the events even if they were created from times in
 *   different time zones.  For example, subtracting 1 PM Eastern Time from 1
 *   PM Pacific Time on the same day yields 0.125 (1/8 of a day, or 3 hours).
 *
 *   The comparison operators (< > <= >=) compare two Date values by order of
 *   occurrence in time.  For example, a > b is true if a is later than b.
 *   The comparison is done in universal time, so the comparison yields the
 *   actual event order, not the nominal local time order.  For example, 2 PM
 *   Eastern Time is earlier than 1 PM Pacific Time on any given day.
 *
 *   Time zone specifications: when a time zone is specified in a constructor
 *   or method argument, you can supply a TimeZone object, or a string with
 *   the name of a time zone, using the same formats that the TimeZone
 *   constructor accepts.  See the TimeZone object for more information.  The
 *   default if you don't specify a time zone is
 *

/*
 *   TimeZone intrinsic class.  A TimeZone object represents a location entry
 *   in the IANA zoneinfo database.  It contains information on the
 *   location's wall clock time settings relative to universal time (UTC),
 *   allowing translations between local wall clock time and UTC.  The object
 *   stores the current clock settings in the location, the current ongoing
 *   rules for future switches between standard and daylight time (if
 *   applicable in the zone), and a full history of the past changes to the
 *   location's time settings, including standard/daylight time changes,
 *   redefinitions of the time zone, and changes in the location from one
 *   time zone to another.  (For example, some US cities that lie near zone
 *   borders have switched their time zones at various points in their
 *   history.)  The historical information for most zones goes back to the
 *   original establishment of standard time zones, typically in the late
 *   19th century, and for dates before that, the history usually includes
 *   the Local Mean Time settings for the location.  The history information
 *   allows the accurate reconstruction of the local time representation for
 *   virtually any date and time in the past, present, or future.
 *
 *   Construction:
 *
 *.    new TimeZone() - creates a TimeZone object representing the local
 *.        system time zone.  Note that a TimeZone object created this way
 *.        will always represent the local zone.  If the game is saved on
 *.        one machine and restored on another that uses a different local
 *.        time zone, the restored object will represent the new machine's
 *.        local time zone after the restore.
 *
 *.   new TimeZone(integer) - creates a TimeZone object representing the
 *.        given offset from UTC, in seconds.  Positive values are east of
 *.        UTC, negative values are west; for example, Pacific Standard
 *.        Time is 8 hours west of UTC, so you'd use -8*60*60 as the offset.
 *.        This type of TimeZone represents a fixed offset
 *
 *.   new TimeZone('name') - creates a TimeZone object for the given zone
 *.        name.  This can use a number of formats:
 *.
 *.        'America/New_York' - a name from the IANA zoneinfo database.
 *.            This is the best way to specify a zone because it's
 *.            unambiguous.
 *.
 *.        'Z', 'UTC' - UTC (Universal Time Coordinated, also sometimes
 *.            called GMT/Greenwich Mean Time, or Z/Zulu time)
 *
 *.        'EST' - a colloquial English abbreviation for a local time
 *.            zone.  Many of these are ambiguous, since some zone names
 *.            are used in several different regions.  For example,
 *.            'CST' is used in the US, Brazil, Australia, and China,
 *.            for time zones at different offsets from UTC.  When the
 *.            name is ambiguous, we use a fixed mapping that tends to
 *.            favor zones in the US and Europe.  This format is mapped
 *.            to a zoneinfo entry, so the actual underlying zone will
 *.            be one of the location-based entries.  For example, 'EST'
 *.            is mapped to 'America/New_York'.  This is important
 *.            because it means that the TimeZone object uses the full
 *.            rule set and history for the mapped zone, which might
 *.            differ from the history of the same nominal zone in other
 *.            locations; e.g., 'America/New_York' and 'Canada/Montreal'
 *.            are both on Eastern Time, but they have some differences
 *.            in their historical daylight savings rules.
 *
 *.        'PST8PDT' - a POSIX TZ-style string, with the standard time
 *.            abbreviation, the standard time offset in hours (and
 *.            optionally minutes and seconds, with colons), the daylight
 *.            time abbreviation, and optionally the daylight time
 *.            offset (which defaults to one hour ahead of standard
 *.            time when not specified).  This is somewhat less ambiguous
 *.            than using just the zone abbreviation, but is still
 *
 *.        '+0430' or 'UTC+0430' - four hours thirty minutes east of UTC;
 *.            this can also be written as '+4:30' or '+4:30:00'.  For a
 *.            whole number of hours, you can write it as simply '+4', for
 *.            example.  A negative number is west of UTC; e.g., Pacific
 *.            Standard Time is '-8'.  When using this format, the zone
 *.            represents a fixed time offset from UTC; it's not tied to
 *.            any location or named time zone, and doesn't use daylight
 *.            savings time.
 *
 *   Note that the commonly used time zone names (e.g., PST, or Pacific
 *   Standard Time) aren't allowed.  The standard time zone names are
 *   ambiguous; for example, CST refers to at least four different time zones
 *   (USA Central Standard Time, Australia Central Standard Time, China
 *   Standard Time, and Cuba Summer Time).

     *   If 'date' is supplied, it must be a Date object.  This returns a
     *   list describing the single period in the timezone history that
     *   applies to the given date.  The list contains [date, offset, save,
     *   abbr], where 'date' is a Date object giving the starting date when
     *   the history item took effect; 'offset' is the offset from UTC in
     *   milliseconds of standard time in the zone during this period, using
     *   the zoneinfo convention that positive values are east of GMT; 'save'
     *   is the additional time added if daylight savings is in effect during
     *   this period, in milliseconds, or zero if standard time is in effect;
     *   and 'abbr' is a string giving the abbreviation for the zone during
     *   this period ('PST', 'EDT', etc).  Each period in the history is
     *   entirely in daylight or standard time; if 'save' is zero, standard
     *   time is in effect, otherwise daylight time.
     *
     *   If 'date' is omitted or nil, this returns a list of all of the
     *   pre-computed changes in the timezone's history, including definition
     *   changes and daylight time changes.  Each list entry is a sublist of
     *   the form described above.
     *
     *   In a full history, the first and last items are special.  The first
     *   item represents the settings in the location prior to the
     *   establishment of standard time zones; this is usually a "local mean
     *   time" setting (with abbreviation LMT) for the mean solar time at the
     *   location.  The last item represents the last pre-computed history
     *   entry, which is sometimes in the future; further transitions after
     *   this item might occur if the zone has ongoing rules.
     *
     *   In many cases, the history list contains a number of periods that
     *   could have been inferred from the ongoing rules, so strictly
     *   speaking they don't need to be enumerated in the history.  When
     *   they're included, it's for faster run-time lookup.  TADS
     *   pre-computes rule-based transitions up to the present and a few
     *   years into the future, since history-based lookups are much faster
     *   than applying the rules.  We expect that the typical program will
     *   mostly work with dates close to the present time, so we pre-compute
     *   transitions for a few years into the future to speed things up for
     *   the typical case.  For changes after the last enumerated entry, TADS
     *   applies the rules, so transitions in the far future will be
     *   correctly figured when needed.

     *   Get the ongoing rules that are in effect after the last enumerated
     *   history item.  This returns a list of the rules for future changes
     *   to the zone; each rule fires once annually, and encodes the day of
     *   year when the rule fires, and the new clock settings in effect after
     *   the rule fires.  Virtually all zones that use ongoing rules have
     *   exactly two: one for the annual change to daylight savings time in
     *   the spring, and one for the return to standard time in the fall.
     *   Each rule's firing date is specified in an abstract format designed
     *   to handle the variety of regional daylight savings schemes: "last
     *   Sunday in March", "second Sunday in November", "January 15", etc.
     *
     *   Each rule in the list is described by a sublist: [abbr, offset,
     *   save, when, mm, typ, dd, wkday, time, zone].  'abbr' is a string
     *   with the time zone abbreviation while the rule is in effect; most
     *   zones use one abbreviation for standard time and another for
     *   daylight time, so each rule tells us the abbreviation to use while
     *   the rule is in effect.  'offset' is the standard time GMT offset, in
     *   milliseconds, while the rule is in effect, and 'save' is the
     *   additional offset for daylight savings time - so the full offset
     *   while the rule is in effect is offset+save.  'when' is a string with
     *   a human-readable description of the firing date: this will be of the
     *   form 'Mar last Sun' (for the last Sunday in March), 'Mar Sun>=1' for
     *   the first Sunday in March on or after March 1, 'Mar Sun<=28' for the
     *   last Sunday in March on or before March 28, 'Mar 7' for March 7, or
     *   'DOY 72' for the 72nd day of the year.  Next we have the same firing
     *   date information in a more computer-friendly format: 'mm' is the
     *   month number, 1-12 for Jan-Dec; 'typ' is an integer giving the type
     *   of date specification (0 for a fixed day of the month 'mm/dd', 1 for
     *   the last <weekday> of month <mm>, 2 for the first <weekday> of month
     *   <mm> on or after day <dd>, and 3 for the last <weekday> of month
     *   <mm> on or before day <dd>), 'dd' is the day of the month (which is
     *   ignored if 'typ' is 1), 'wkday' is the day of the week, 1-7 for
     *   Sunday-Saturday (which is ignored if 'typ' is 0).  'time' is the
     *   time of day the rule goes into effect, as milliseconds after
     *   midnight.  'zone' is a code for the timezone used to interpret the
     *   date and time; this is usually 'w' for local wall clock time (in
     *   other words, the local time zone that was in effect up until the
     *   moment this rule takes effect - so if this is a daylight savings
     *   rule, the rule is stated in terms of local standard time, and vice
     *   versa), but can also be 's' for local standard time (in other words,
     *   if the previous period was in daylight time, ignore that and read
     *   this rule's time in terms of local standard time instead), or 'u'
     *   for UTC.  Note that the zone has to be applied to the full
     *   date-and-time value, since an 's' or 'u' could conceivably cause the
     *   local date and the date in the rule's zone to differ by a day at the
     *   time of day of the rule.
