/*
 *   A FileName represents the name of a file in the local operating
 *   system.  The File object methods that take filename specifications
 *   accept FileName objects as well as ordinary strings.
 *
 *   It's easier to write portable code if you manipulate filenames using
 *   the FileName class rather than using ordinary strings.  TADS runs on
 *   several different operating systems with differing syntax rules for
 *   constructing file names and directory paths.  The FileName class
 *   handles the different rules that apply on each system.
 *
 *   Construction:
 *
 *.    new FileName() - creates a FileName object representing the working
 *.            directory (e.g., '.' on Unix or Windows)
 *
 *.    new FileName(str) - creates a FileName from a string 'str' giving a
 *.            file path in local filename syntax.
 *
 *.    new FileName(path, name) - creates a FileName from a path and
 *.            a file name.  'path' and 'name' can each be a FileName
 *.            object or a string using local filename syntax.  The
 *.            new object represents the combined path
 *
 *.    new FileName(specialID) - creates a FileName from one of the special
 *.            file identifiers defined in file.h.
 *
 *   You can also use the fromUniversal() static method, which creates a
 *   FileName from a path in universal (URL-style) notation.
 *
 *   String conversions: using a FileName object in a context where a
 *   string is required (such as displaying it) automatically converts the
 *   object to a string giving the local file name path.
 *
 *   Operators:
 *
 *.    FileName + string  => yields a new FileName object combining
 *.            the path given by FileName and the string naming a file,
 *.            in local naming conventions.
 *
 *.    FileName + FileName  => yields a new FileName object combining
 *.            the two names, treating the first as a directory path.
 *
 *.    FileName == string (or !=) OR
 *.    FileName == FileName
 *.            Compares the FileName to the string or other filename path.
 *.            This does a superficial comparison of the path contents,
 *.            without attempting to correlate the path to the actual file
 *.            system layout.  For example, it doesn't resolve symbolic
 *.            links on Unix or apply working directories to local paths.

    *
    *   If the file is a symbolic link, the method's behavior depends on
    *   'asLink'.  A symbolic link is a special type of file supported on
    *   some operating systems that serves as a pointer or proxy for
    *   another file.  If the file is a link, and 'asLink' is omitted or
    *   nil, the method returns information on the target of the link; this
    *   is the default because symbolic links in generally act as
    *   transparent proxies for their targets, so for most purposes a
    *   caller should be interested in the target file's metadata.
    *   However, a symbolic link also has a separate identity of its own as
    *   a link, so callers might sometimes be interested in the metadata
    *   for the link rather than its target.  To get information on the
    *   link itself, set 'asLink' to true.  'asLink' has no effect for
    *   ordinary non-link files, and also has no effect for "hard" links on
    *   systems that support those as well.
    *
    *   Most of the FileTypeXxx bits are mutually exclusive, but it's
    *   possible that more than one bit will be set, so test using '&'
    *   (e.g., (f.getFileType() & FileTypeDir)).
