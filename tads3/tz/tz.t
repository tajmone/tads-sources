 *   This file is part of the TADS 3 VM source code.  Please see the
 *   accompanying license file, LICENSE.TXT, for information on using and
 *   copying this software.
 *
 *   This is a compiler for the IANA timezone database (known as "tz" or
 *   "zoneinfo").  It reads the zoneinfo source files and generates a
 *   custom binary file containing an encoded version of the rules.  The
 *   TADS 3 VM's Date intrinsic class reads this binary file to perform
 *   mappings between local time zones and universal time (UTC).  The
 *   zoneinfo sources contain a detailed history of time zone rules by
 *   region and timeline, including daylight savings time transitions.
 *   This historical information makes it possible for the Date class to
 *   calculate the correct local time in time zones around the world on
 *   arbitrary dates in the past, present, and future.
 *
 *   To build the binary version of the database, run this program like so:
 *
 *.    t3run -plain tz <IANA database directory path> <output file name>
 *
 *   The IANA timezone database files are updated regularly, out of
 *   necessity.  The rules governing time zones in a given region are set
 *   by regional authorities (usually at the national level), and these
 *   rules are surprisingly volatile.  It perhaps shouldn't be surprising
 *   that the *historical* development of time zones involved a lot of
 *   revising and rethinking, given rapid changes over the past couple of
 *   centuries in science and technology.  What is surprising is how often
 *   the rules continue to change in the present day.  The rules for
 *   daylight savings time in particular continue to change with some
 *   frequency.  In fact, some countries don't have formulaic DST settings
 *   at all, but rather elect to set their DST transition points anew each
 *   year by fiat.  Anyway, the point is that the zoneinfo database will
 *   never be "done"; it will continue to be updated regularly to keep up
 *   with contemporary changes made by regional authorities.  This means
 *   that the TADS version will have to be updated regularly.  The update
 *   process is fairly easy; we just grab a new copy of the zoneinfo
 *   sources from the IANA site, and run this compiler to generate the TADS
 *   binary.  The TADS version is in an external binary file, so users can
 *   update it at any time without updating their whole TADS installation.
 *
 *   Note that the TADS source code distribution doesn't contain the IANA
 *   database source files.  Those files are explicitly in the public
 *   domain, but there's some controversy (as of early 2012) about the
 *   provenance of some portions of their contents; as long as that's being
 *   sorted out, it seems best to keep them at arm's length.  Besides, it's
 *   better to avoid duplicating this kind of third-party data anyway,
 *   since doing so can create confusion over which version to use.  You
 *   can find the current sources at http://www.iana.org/time-zones.
 *
 *   In our binary format, all time values are expressed in milliseconds.

         *   at a sort of run-time.  But the older transitions that occur

         *   whole scope of time that we want to cover, and leave the whole
         *   thing as a table search exercise at run-time.  That's more or
         *   less what zic does, although v2 of its output format (tzif)
         *   does at least make a half-hearted attempt at including the
         *   ongoing rules.  The problem with enumerating all transitions
         *   into the future is that we can't predict what the required
         *   scope will be, since users could want dates far into the
         *   future; we just can't build a big enough table to be sure
         *   we've covered every possible request.  This means that the
         *   transition list will simply never be sufficient on its own; we
         *   have to supplement it with a formula once we reach the point
         *   where the only rules remaining will be applied into the
         *   indefinite future.  So given that we need to do that anyway,
         *   we can compress the transition list somewhat by finding the
         *   point in the list where the formula that we have to work out
         *   anyway will produce the remaining list entries.  We can then
         *   elide those list entries.
         *
         *   What's more, we have to go through this exercise even if we
         *   didn't use it to compress the table, because a second output
         *   of this scan is that precise list of open-ended rules.  We can
         *   identify those rules by looking for transition items that we
         *   can remove; a removable transition item is one that's caused
         *   by an open-ended rule that's only followed by other
         *   transitions caused by open-ended rules.  The set of open-ended
         *   rules that caused these transitions comprises our "from now
         *   on" list.
         *
         *   As a run-time speed optimization, though, keep resolved
         *   transitions up through 5 years of the current date.  We can
         *   probably assume that current (at run-time) and nearby dates
         *   will be by far the most frequently used in practice, so it
         *   seems worth trading some memory for fast translations of those
         *   dates between UTC and local.  The 5-year deadline is
         *   arbitrary; it's meant to take into account the longevity of
         *   the generated database file (probably a couple of years is
         *   sufficient, as TADS tends to get updated on the order of a
         *   couple of times a year, and the official source database is
         *   updated a few times a year) and the locus of dates used in
         *   programs (mostly these will be dates in the present and recent
         *   past, but some programs might use near future dates as well).
         *
         *   One further special constraint: keep at least one fixed
         *   transition in the list for each open-ended rule.  This
         *   simplifies things for the run-time system when it's trying to
         *   work out a future date, because it guarantees that the period
         *   just before a rule's trigger date is defined by the prior
         *   open-ended rule (in month order, treating the list as
         *   circular).  This is guaranteed because we know that every
         *   after the last transition is controlled by a recurrence of a
         *   open-ended rule.  It's important to know the controlling rule
         *   for the prior period, because rules are often stated in terms
         *   of wall-clock time, which is defined by the prior period's
         *   rules.  This makes working backwards from a given point in
         *   time almost impossible in general, but it becomes easy once
         *   we're unambiguously in that period of cycling through the
         *   recurring rules ad infinitum.
         *
         *   Start by finding the last transition NOT caused by an
         *   open-ended item.

             *   far out.  The underlying Gregorian calendar will probably
             *   need work by Y3K or so (since its leap year system isn't

             *   1000 years of transitions for a few hundred time zones
             *   isn't really practical either.
             *
             *   So our approach is as follows.  We'll generate transitions

             *   open-ended - that is, with TO years of 'max' - or until
             *   there are no more rules in effect.  At that point, it will
             *   be possible to infer all future transitions from the
             *   remaining open-ended rules.
